A company runs applications on Amazon EC2 instances in one AWS Region. The company wants to back up the EC2 instances to a second Region. The company also wants to provision EC2 resources in the second Region and manage the EC2 instances centrally from one AWS account. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Create a disaster recovery (DR) plan that has a similar number of EC2 instances in the second Region. Configure data replication. 
B. Create point-in-time Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots of the EC2 instances. Copy the snapshots to the second Region periodically. 
C. Create a backup plan by using AWS Backup. Configure cross-Region backup to the second Region for the EC2 instances. 
D. Deploy a similar number of EC2 instances in the second Region. Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data from the source Region to the second Region.

Using AWS Backup, you can create backup plans that automate the backup process for your EC2 instances. By configuring cross-Region backup, you can ensure that backups are replicated to the second Region, providing a disaster recovery capability. This solution is cost-effective as it leverages AWS Backup's built-in features and eliminates the need for manual snapshot management or deploying and managing additional EC2 instances in the second Region.
