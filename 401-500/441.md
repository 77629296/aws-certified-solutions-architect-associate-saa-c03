A company hosts a multi-tier web application on Amazon Linux Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones.

What should a solutions architect do to redesign the application MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Update the Auto Scaling group to use Reserved Instances instead of On-Demand Instances. 
B. Update the Auto Scaling group to scale by launching Spot Instances instead of On-Demand Instances. 
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to host the static web contents from an Amazon S3 bucket. 
D. Create an AWS Lambda function behind an Amazon API Gateway API to host the static website contents.
