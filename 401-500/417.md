A company uses Amazon EC2 instances and AWS Lambda functions to run its application. The company has VPCs with public subnets and private subnets in its AWS account. The EC2 instances run in a private subnet in one of the VPCs. The Lambda functions need direct network access to the EC2 instances for the application to work. The application will run for at least 1 year. The company expects the number of Lambda functions that the application uses to increase during that time. The company wants to maximize its savings on all application resources and to keep network latency between the services low. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan Optimize the Lambda functions’ duration and memory usage and the number of invocations. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnet that contains the EC2 instances. 
B. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan Optimize the Lambda functions' duration and memory usage, the number of invocations, and the amount of data that is transferred. Connect the Lambda functions to a public subnet in the same VPC where the EC2 instances run. 
C. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Optimize the Lambda functions’ duration and memory usage, the number of invocations, and the amount of data that is transferred. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnet that contains the EC2 instances. 
D. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Optimize the Lambda functions’ duration and memory usage, the number of invocations, and the amount of data that is transferred. Keep the Lambda functions in the Lambda service VPC.

By purchasing a Compute Savings Plan, the company can save on the costs of running both EC2 instances and Lambda functions. The Lambda functions can be connected to the private subnet that contains the EC2 instances through a VPC endpoint for AWS services or a VPC peering connection. This provides direct network access to the EC2 instances while keeping the traffic within the private network, which helps to minimize network latency. 
Optimizing the Lambda functions’ duration, memory usage, number of invocations, and amount of data transferred can help to further minimize costs and improve performance. Additionally, using a private subnet helps to ensure that the EC2 instances are not directly accessible from the public internet, which is a security best practice.
