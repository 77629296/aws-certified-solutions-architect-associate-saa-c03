A company is deploying a new application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application writes data to Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. The company needs to ensure that all data that is written to the EBS volumes is encrypted at rest. Which solution will meet this requirement? 

A. Create an IAM role that specifies EBS encryption. Attach the role to the EC2 instances. 
B. Create the EBS volumes as encrypted volumes. Attach the EBS volumes to the EC2 instances. 
C. Create an EC2 instance tag that has a key of Encrypt and a value of True. Tag all instances that require encryption at the EBS level. 
D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key policy that enforces EBS encryption in the account. Ensure that the key policy is active

When you create an EBS volume, you can specify whether to encrypt the volume. If you choose to encrypt the volume, all data written to the volume is automatically encrypted at rest using AWS-managed keys. You can also use customer-managed keys (CMKs) stored in AWS KMS to encrypt and protect your EBS volumes. You can create encrypted EBS volumes and attach them to EC2 instances to ensure that all data written to the volumes is encrypted at rest.
