A company hosts a website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The website serves static content. Website trafic is increasing, and the company is concerned about a potential increase in cost. 

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache state files at edge locations 
B. Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Connect the ALB to the ElastiCache cluster to serve cached files 
C. Create an AWS WAF web ACL and associate it with the ALB. Add a rule to the web ACL to cache static files 
D. Create a second ALB in an alternative AWS Region. Route user trafic to the closest Region to minimize data transfer costs
