A company is designing a containerized application that will use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The application needs to access a shared file system that is highly durable and can recover data to another AWS Region with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 8 hours. The file system needs to provide a mount target m each Availability Zone within a Region. A solutions architect wants to use AWS Backup to manage the replication to another Region. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ deployment 
B. Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with a Multi-AZ deployment 
C. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with the Standard storage class 
D. Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

EFS Replication can replicate your file system data to another Region or within the same Region without requiring additional infrastructure or a custom process. Amazon EFS Replication automatically and transparently replicates your data to a second file system in a Region or AZ of your choice. You can use the Amazon EFS console, AWS CLI, and APIs to activate replication on an existing file system. EFS Replication is continual and provides a recovery point objective (RPO) and a recovery time objective (RTO) of minutes, helping you meet your compliance and business continuity goals.
