A company that uses AWS is building an application to transfer data to a product manufacturer. The company has its own identity provider (IdP). The company wants the IdP to authenticate application users while the users use the application to transfer data. The company must use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) protocol. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication. 
B. Use Amazon AppFlow Â­flows to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task for IdP authentication. 
C. Use AWS Transfer Family to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication. 
D. Use AWS Storage Gateway to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool for IdP authentication

AWS Transfer Family securely scales your recurring business-to-business file transfers to AWS Storage services using SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2 protocols.
