A solutions architect is implementing a complex Java application with a MySQL database. The Java application must be deployed on Apache Tomcat and must be highly available. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
A. Deploy the application in AWS Lambda. Configure an Amazon API Gateway API to connect with the Lambda functions. 
B. Deploy the application by using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Configure a load-balanced environment and a rolling deployment policy. 
C. Migrate the database to Amazon ElastiCache. Configure the ElastiCache security group to allow access from the application. 
D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance. Install a MySQL server on the EC2 instance. Configure the application on the server. Create an AMI. Use the AMI to create a launch template with an Auto Scaling group

AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an easy and quick way to deploy, manage, and scale applications. It supports a variety of platforms, including Java and Apache Tomcat. By using Elastic Beanstalk, the solutions architect can upload the Java application and configure the environment to run Apache Tomcat.
