An ecommerce company is experiencing an increase in user trafic. The companyâ€™s store is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances as a two-tier web application consisting of a web tier and a separate database tier. As trafic increases, the company notices that the architecture is causing significant delays in sending timely marketing and order confirmation email to users. The company wants to reduce the time it spends resolving complex email delivery issues and minimize operational overhead. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

B. Configure the web instance to send email through Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES). 
C. Configure the web instance to send email through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
