A company has multiple VPCs across AWS Regions to support and run workloads that are isolated from workloads in other Regions. Because of a recent application launch requirement, the companyâ€™s VPCs must communicate with all other VPCs across all Regions. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort? 

A. Use VPC peering to manage VPC communication in a single Region. Use VPC peering across Regions to manage VPC communications. 
B. Use AWS Direct Connect gateways across all Regions to connect VPCs across regions and manage VPC communications. 
C. Use AWS Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region and Transit Gateway peering across Regions to manage VPC communications. 
D. Use AWS PrivateLink across all Regions to connect VPCs across Regions and manage VPC communications
