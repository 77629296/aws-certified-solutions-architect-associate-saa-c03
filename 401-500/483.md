A company containerized a Windows job that runs on .NET 6 Framework under a Windows container. The company wants to run this job in the AWS Cloud. The job runs every 10 minutes. The jobâ€™s runtime varies between 1 minute and 3 minutes. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Create an AWS Lambda function based on the container image of the job. Configure Amazon EventBridge to invoke the function every 10 minutes. 
B. Use AWS Batch to create a job that uses AWS Fargate resources. Configure the job scheduling to run every 10 minutes. 
C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate to run the job. Create a scheduled task based on the container image of the job to run every 10 minutes. 
D. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate to run the job. Create a standalone task based on the container image of the job. Use Windows task scheduler to run the job every 10 minutes.

C is the most cost-effective solution for running a short-lived Windows container job on a schedule. 
Using Amazon ECS scheduled tasks on Fargate eliminates the need to provision EC2 resources. You pay only for the duration the task runs. Scheduled tasks handle scheduling the jobs and scaling resources automatically. This is lower cost than managing your own scaling via Lambda or Batch. 
ECS also supports Windows containers natively unlike Lambda (option A). 
Option D still requires provisioning and paying for full time EC2 resources to run a task scheduler even when tasks are not running.
