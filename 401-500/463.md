An IoT company is releasing a mattress that has sensors to collect data about a userâ€™s sleep. The sensors will send data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The sensors collect approximately 2 MB of data every night for each mattress. The company must process and summarize the data for each mattress. The results need to be available as soon as possible. Data processing will require 1 GB of memory and will finish within 30 seconds. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Use AWS Glue with a Scala job 
B. Use Amazon EMR with an Apache Spark script 
C. Use AWS Lambda with a Python script 
D. Use AWS Glue with a PySpark job

The data processing is lightweight, only requiring 1 GB memory and finishing in under 30 seconds. Lambda is designed for short, transient workloads like this. 
Lambda scales automatically, invoking the function as needed when new data arrives. No servers to manage. 
Lambda has a very low cost. You only pay for the compute time used to run the function, billed in 100ms increments. Much cheaper than provisioning EMR or Glue. 
Processing can begin as soon as new data hits the S3 bucket by triggering the Lambda function. Provides low latency
