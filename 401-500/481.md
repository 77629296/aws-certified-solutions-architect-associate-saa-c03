A company hosts a three-tier web application in the AWS Cloud. A Multi-AZAmazon RDS for MySQL server forms the database layer Amazon ElastiCache forms the cache layer. The company wants a caching strategy that adds or updates data in the cache when a customer adds an item to the database. The data in the cache must always match the data in the database. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Implement the lazy loading caching strategy 
B. Implement the write-through caching strategy 
C. Implement the adding TTL caching strategy 
D. Implement the AWS AppConfig caching strategy

In the write-through caching strategy, when a customer adds or updates an item in the database, the application first writes the data to the database and then updates the cache with the same data. This ensures that the cache is always synchronized with the database, as every write operation triggers an update to the cache.
