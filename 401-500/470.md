A company has applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances with IPv6 addresses. The applications must initiate communications with other external applications using the internet.

A. Create a NAT gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table 
B. Create an internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table 
C. Create a virtual private gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table 
D. Create an egress-only internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table
