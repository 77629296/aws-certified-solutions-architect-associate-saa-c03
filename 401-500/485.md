A company is looking for a solution that can store video archives in AWS from old news footage. The company needs to minimize costs and will rarely need to restore these files. When the files are needed, they must be available in a maximum of five minutes. What is the MOST cost-effective solution? 

A. Store the video archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and use Expedited retrievals. 
B. Store the video archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and use Standard retrievals. 
C. Store the video archives in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). 
D. Store the video archives in Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

By choosing Expedited retrievals in Amazon S3 Glacier, you can reduce the retrieval time to minutes, making it suitable for scenarios where quick access is required. Expedited retrievals come with a higher cost per retrieval compared to standard retrievals but provide faster access to your archived data.
