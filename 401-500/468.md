A company is developing a microservices application that will provide a search catalog for customers. The company must use REST APIs to present the frontend of the application to users. The REST APIs must access the backend services that the company hosts in containers in private VPC subnets. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Design a WebSocket API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a private VPC link for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS. 
B. Design a REST API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a private VPC link for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS. 
C. Design a WebSocket API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a security group for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS.
D. Design a REST API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a security group for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS

Private VPC Link: To enable the REST API in API Gateway to access the backend services hosted in Amazon ECS, you can create a private VPC link. This establishes a private network connection between the API Gateway and ECS containers, allowing secure communication without traversing the public internet.
