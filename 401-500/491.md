A solutions architect is designing an asynchronous application to process credit card data validation requests for a bank. The application must be secure and be able to process each request at least once. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Use AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queues as the event source. Use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) for encryption. Add the kms:Decrypt permission for the Lambda execution role. 
B. Use AWS Lambda event source mapping. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the event source. Use SQS managed encryption keys (SSE-SQS) for encryption. Add the encryption key invocation permission for the Lambda function. 
C. Use the AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the event source. Use AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Add the kms:Decrypt permission for the Lambda execution role. 
D. Use the AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queues as the event source. Use AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for encryption. Add the encryption key invocation permission for the Lambda function.
