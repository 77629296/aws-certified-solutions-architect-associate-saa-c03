A company has two VPCs named Management and Production. The Management VPC uses VPNs through a customer gateway to connect to a single device in the data center. The Production VPC uses a virtual private gateway with two attached AWS Direct Connect connections. The Management and Production VPCs both use a single VPC peering connection to allow communication between the applications. What should a solutions architect do to mitigate any single point of failure in this architecture? 

A. Add a set of VPNs between the Management and Production VPCs. 
B. Add a second virtual private gateway and attach it to the Management VPC. 
C. Add a second set of VPNs to the Management VPC from a second customer gateway device. 
D. Add a second VPC peering connection between the Management VPC and the Production VPC
