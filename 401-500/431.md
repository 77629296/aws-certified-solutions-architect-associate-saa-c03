A company has developed a new video game as a web application. The application is in a three-tier architecture in a VPC with Amazon RDS for MySQL in the database layer. Several players will compete concurrently online. The gameâ€™s developers want to display a top-10 scoreboard in near-real time and offer the ability to stop and restore the game while preserving the current scores. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster to cache the scores for the web application to display. 
B. Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to compute and cache the scores for the web application to display. 
C. Place an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the web application to cache the scoreboard in a section of the application. 
D. Create a read replica on Amazon RDS for MySQL to run queries to compute the scoreboard and serve the read trafic to the web application

ElastiCache for Redis sorts and ranks datasets
