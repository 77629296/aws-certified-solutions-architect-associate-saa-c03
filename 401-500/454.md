A company has resources across multiple AWS Regions and accounts. A newly hired solutions architect discovers a previous employee did not provide details about the resources inventory. The solutions architect needs to build and map the relationship details of the various workloads across all accounts. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally eficient way? 

A. Use AWS Systems Manager Inventory to generate a map view from the detailed view report. 
B. Use AWS Step Functions to collect workload details. Build architecture diagrams of the workloads manually. 
C. Use Workload Discovery on AWS to generate architecture diagrams of the workloads. 
D. Use AWS X-Ray to view the workload details. Build architecture diagrams with relationships.

Workload Discovery on AWS (formerly called AWS Perspective) is a tool to visualize AWS Cloud workloads. Use Workload Discovery on AWS to build, customize, and share detailed architecture diagrams of your workloads based on live data from AWS.
