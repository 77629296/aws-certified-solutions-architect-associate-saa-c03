A company uses a 100 GB Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server Single-AZ DB instance in the us-east-1 Region to store customer transactions. The company needs high availability and automatic recovery for the DB instance. The company must also run reports on the RDS database several times a year. The report process causes transactions to take longer than usual to post to the customersâ€™ accounts. The company needs a solution that will improve the performance of the report process. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Modify the DB instance from a Single-AZ DB instance to a Multi-AZ deployment. 
B. Take a snapshot of the current DB instance. Restore the snapshot to a new RDS deployment in another Availability Zone. 
C. Create a read replica of the DB instance in a different Availability Zone. Point all requests for reports to the read replica. 
D. Migrate the database to RDS Custom. 
E. Use RDS Proxy to limit reporting requests to the maintenance window.
