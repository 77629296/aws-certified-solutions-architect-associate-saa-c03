A company runs a web application that is backed by Amazon RDS. A new database administrator caused data loss by accidentally editing information in a database table. To help recover from this type of incident, the company wants the ability to restore the database to its state from 5 minutes before any change within the last 30 days. Which feature should the solutions architect include in the design to meet this requirement? 

A. Read replicas 
B. Manual snapshots 
C. Automated backups 
D. Multi-AZ deployments

Automated backups allow you to recover your database to any point in time within your specified retention period, which can be up to 35 days. The recovery process creates a new Amazon RDS instance with a new endpoint, and the process takes time proportional to the size of the database. Automated backups are enabled by default and occur daily during the backup window. This feature provides an easy and convenient way to recover from data loss incidents such as the one described in the scenario.
