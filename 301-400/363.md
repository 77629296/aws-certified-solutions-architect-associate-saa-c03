A company is building a game system that needs to send unique events to separate leaderboard, matchmaking, and authentication services concurrently. The company needs an AWS event-driven system that guarantees the order of the events. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Amazon EventBridge event bus 
B. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) FIFO topics 
C. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) standard topics 
D. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues

SQS looks like a good idea first, but since we have to send the same message to multiple destination, even if SQS could do it, SNS is much more dedicated to this kind of usage.
