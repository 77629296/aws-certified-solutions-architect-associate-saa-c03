A solutions architect must secure a VPC network that hosts Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances contain highly sensitive data and run in a private subnet. According to company policy, the EC2 instances that run in the VPC can access only approved third-party software repositories on the internet for software product updates that use the third party’s URL. Other internet trafic must be blocked. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Update the route table for the private subnet to route the outbound trafic to an AWS Network Firewall firewall. Configure domain list rule groups. 
B. Set up an AWS WAF web ACL. Create a custom set of rules that filter trafic requests based on source and destination IP address range sets. 
C. Implement strict inbound security group rules. Configure an outbound rule that allows trafic only to the authorized software repositories on the internet by specifying the URLs. 
D. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the EC2 instances. Direct all outbound trafic to the ALB. Use a URL-based rule listener in the ALB’s target group for outbound access to the internet.

Correct Answer A. Send the outbound connection from EC2 to Network Firewall. In Network Firewall, create stateful outbound rules to allow certain domains for software patch download and deny all other domains.
