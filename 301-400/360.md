A company uses Amazon API Gateway to run a private gateway with two REST APIs in the same VPC. The BuyStock RESTful web service calls the CheckFunds RESTful web service to ensure that enough funds are available before a stock can be purchased. The company has noticed in the VPC Â­flow logs that the BuyStock RESTful web service calls the CheckFunds RESTful web service over the internet instead of through the VPC. A solutions architect must implement a solution so that the APIs communicate through the VPC. Which solution will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the code? 

A. Add an X-API-Key header in the HTTP header for authorization. 
B. Use an interface endpoint. 
C. Use a gateway endpoint. 
D. Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue between the two REST APIs.

an interface endpoint is a horizontally scaled, redundant VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity to a service. It is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to the AWS service. Interface endpoints are used to connect VPCs with AWS services
