A company is developing a real-time multiplayer game that uses UDP for communications between the client and servers in an Auto Scaling group. Spikes in demand are anticipated during the day, so the game server platform must adapt accordingly. Developers want to store gamer scores and other non-relational data in a database solution that will scale without intervention. Which solution should a solutions architect recommend? 

A. Use Amazon Route 53 for trafic distribution and Amazon Aurora Serverless for data storage. 
B. Use a Network Load Balancer for trafic distribution and Amazon DynamoDB on-demand for data storage. 
C. Use a Network Load Balancer for trafic distribution and Amazon Aurora Global Database for data storage. 
D. Use an Application Load Balancer for trafic distribution and Amazon DynamoDB global tables for data storage

UDP = NLB
Non-relational data = Dynamo DB
