A company has an application that runs on several Amazon EC2 instances. Each EC2 instance has multiple Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) data volumes attached to it. The application’s EC2 instance configuration and data need to be backed up nightly. The application also needs to be recoverable in a different AWS Region. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally eficient way? 

A. Write an AWS Lambda function that schedules nightly snapshots of the application’s EBS volumes and copies the snapshots to a different Region. 

B. Create a backup plan by using AWS Backup to perform nightly backups. Copy the backups to another Region. Add the application’s EC2 instances as resources. 

C. Create a backup plan by using AWS Backup to perform nightly backups. Copy the backups to another Region. Add the application’s EBS volumes as resources. 

D. Write an AWS Lambda function that schedules nightly snapshots of the application's EBS volumes and copies the snapshots to a different Availability Zone.

B is answer so the requirement is "The application’s EC2 instance configuration and data need to be backed up nightly" so we need "add the application’s EC2 instances as resources". This option will backup both EC2 configuration and data
