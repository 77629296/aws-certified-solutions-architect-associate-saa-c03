A hospital needs to store patient records in an Amazon S3 bucket. The hospitalâ€™s compliance team must ensure that all protected health information (PHI) is encrypted in transit and at rest. The compliance team must administer the encryption key for data at rest. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create a public SSL/TLS certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Associate the certificate with Amazon S3. Configure default encryption for each S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Assign the compliance team to manage the KMS keys. 
B. Use the aws:SecureTransport condition on S3 bucket policies to allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS). Configure default encryption for each S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Assign the compliance team to manage the SSE-S3 keys. 
C. Use the aws:SecureTransport condition on S3 bucket policies to allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS). Configure default encryption for each S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Assign the compliance team to manage the KMS keys. 
D. Use the aws:SecureTransport condition on S3 bucket policies to allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS). Use Amazon Macie to protect the sensitive data that is stored in Amazon S3. Assign the compliance team to manage Macie.
