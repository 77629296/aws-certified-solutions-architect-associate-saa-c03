A company has a three-tier application on AWS that ingests sensor data from its users’ devices. The trafic ­ flows through a Network Load Balancer (NLB), then to Amazon EC2 instances for the web tier, and finally to EC2 instances for the application tier. The application tier makes calls to a database. What should a solutions architect do to improve the security of the data in transit? 

A. Configure a TLS listener. Deploy the server certificate on the NLB. 
B. Configure AWS Shield Advanced. Enable AWS WAF on the NLB. 
C. Change the load balancer to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Enable AWS WAF on the ALB. 
D. Encrypt the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instances by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
