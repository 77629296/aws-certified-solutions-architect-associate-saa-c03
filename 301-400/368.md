A solutions architect wants all new users to have specific complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for IAM user passwords. What should the solutions architect do to accomplish this? 

A. Set an overall password policy for the entire AWS account. 
B. Set a password policy for each IAM user in the AWS account. 
C. Use third-party vendor software to set password requirements. 
D. Attach an Amazon CloudWatch rule to the Create_newuser event to set the password with the appropriate requirements

You can set a custom password policy on your AWS account to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for your IAM users' passwords. When you create or change a password policy, most of the password policy settings are enforced the next time your users change their passwords. However, some of the settings are enforced immediately.
