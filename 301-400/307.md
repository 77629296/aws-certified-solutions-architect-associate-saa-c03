A company that primarily runs its application servers on premises has decided to migrate to AWS. The company wants to minimize its need to scale its Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) storage on premises. The company wants only its recently accessed data to remain stored locally. Which AWS solution should the company use to meet these requirements? 

A. Amazon S3 File Gateway 
B. AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway 
C. AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway stored volumes 
D. AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway cached volumes

AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway provides two configurations for connecting to iSCSI storage, namely, stored volumes and cached volumes. 
The stored volume configuration stores the entire data set on-premises and asynchronously backs up the data to AWS. 
The cached volume configuration stores recently accessed data on-premises, and the remaining data is stored in Amazon S3.
