A company is using AWS to design a web application that will process insurance quotes. Users will request quotes from the application. Quotes must be separated by quote type, must be responded to within 24 hours, and must not get lost. The solution must maximize operational eficiency and must minimize maintenance. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Create multiple Amazon Kinesis data streams based on the quote type. Configure the web application to send messages to the proper data stream. Configure each backend group of application servers to use the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to pool messages from its own data stream. 
B. Create an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for each quote type. Subscribe the Lambda function to its associated SNS topic. Configure the application to publish requests for quotes to the appropriate SNS topic. 
C. Create a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues to the SNS topic. Configure SNS message filtering to publish messages to the proper SQS queue based on the quote type. Configure each backend application server to use its own SQS queue. 
D. Create multiple Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams based on the quote type to deliver data streams to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster. Configure the application to send messages to the proper delivery stream. Configure each backend group of application servers to search for the messages from OpenSearch Service and process them accordingly.

Quote types need to be separated: SNS message filtering can be used to publish messages to the appropriate SQS queue based on the quote type, ensuring that quotes are separated by type. 
Quotes must be responded to within 24 hours and must not get lost: SQS provides reliable and scalable queuing for messages, ensuring that quotes will not get lost and can be processed in a timely manner. Additionally, each backend application server can use its own SQS queue, ensuring that quotes are processed efficiently without any delay. 
Operational efficiency and minimizing maintenance: Using a single SNS topic and multiple SQS queues is a scalable and cost-effective approach, which can help to maximize operational efficiency and minimize maintenance. Additionally, SNS and SQS are fully managed services, which means that the company will not need to worry about maintenance tasks such as software updates, hardware upgrades, or scaling the infrastructure.
