A company stores confidential data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database in the ap-southeast-3 Region. The database is encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. The company was recently acquired and must securely share a backup of the database with the acquiring company’s AWS account in ap-southeast-3. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Create a database snapshot. Copy the snapshot to a new unencrypted snapshot. Share the new snapshot with the acquiring company’s AWS account. 
B. Create a database snapshot. Add the acquiring company’s AWS account to the KMS key policy. Share the snapshot with the acquiring company’s AWS account. 
C. Create a database snapshot that uses a different AWS managed KMS key. Add the acquiring company’s AWS account to the KMS key alias. Share the snapshot with the acquiring company's AWS account. 
D. Create a database snapshot. Download the database snapshot. Upload the database snapshot to an Amazon S3 bucket. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the acquiring company’s AWS account.
