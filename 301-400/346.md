A company has an aging network-attached storage (NAS) array in its data center. The NAS array presents SMB shares and NFS shares to client workstations. The company does not want to purchase a new NAS array. The company also does not want to incur the cost of renewing the NAS arrayâ€™s support contract. Some of the data is accessed frequently, but much of the data is inactive. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution that migrates the data to Amazon S3, uses S3 Lifecycle policies, and maintains the same look and feel for the client workstations. The solutions architect has identified AWS Storage Gateway as part of the solution. Which type of storage gateway should the solutions architect provision to meet these requirements? 

A. Volume Gateway 
B. Tape Gateway 
C. Amazon FSx File Gateway 
D. Amazon S3 File Gateway

Amazon S3 File Gateway provides on-premises applications with access to virtually unlimited cloud storage using NFS and SMB file interfaces. It seamlessly moves frequently accessed data to a low-latency cache while storing colder data in Amazon S3, using S3 Lifecycle policies to transition data between storage classes over time.
