A company is migrating an old application to AWS. The application runs a batch job every hour and is CPU intensive. The batch job takes 15 minutes on average with an on-premises server. The server has 64 virtual CPU (vCPU) and 512 GiB of memory. Which solution will run the batch job within 15 minutes with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use AWS Lambda with functional scaling. 
B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with AWS Fargate. 
C. Use Amazon Lightsail with AWS Auto Scaling. 
D. Use AWS Batch on Amazon EC2.

AWS Batch is a fully-managed service that can launch and manage the compute resources needed to execute batch jobs. It can scale the compute environment based on the size and timing of the batch jobs.
