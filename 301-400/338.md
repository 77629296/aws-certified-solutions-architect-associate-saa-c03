A solutions architect must create a disaster recovery (DR) plan for a high-volume software as a service (SaaS) platform. All data for the platform is stored in an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The DR plan must replicate data to a secondary AWS Region. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Use MySQL binary log replication to an Aurora cluster in the secondary Region. Provision one DB instance for the Aurora cluster in the secondary Region. 
B. Set up an Aurora global database for the DB cluster. When setup is complete, remove the DB instance from the secondary Region. 
C. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to continuously replicate data to an Aurora cluster in the secondary Region. Remove the DB instance from the secondary Region. 
D. Set up an Aurora global database for the DB cluster. Specify a minimum of one DB instance in the secondary Region.
