A new employee has joined a company as a deployment engineer. The deployment engineer will be using AWS CloudFormation templates to create multiple AWS resources. A solutions architect wants the deployment engineer to perform job activities while following the principle of least privilege. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to accomplish this goal? (Choose two.) 

A. Have the deployment engineer use AWS account root user credentials for performing AWS CloudFormation stack operations. 
B. Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has the PowerUsers IAM policy attached. 
C. Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has the AdministratorAccess IAM policy attached. 
D. Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has an IAM policy that allows AWS CloudFormation actions only. 
E. Create an IAM role for the deployment engineer to explicitly define the permissions specific to the AWS CloudFormation stack and launch stacks using that IAM role.
