A company has a Java application that uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to parse messages. The application cannot parse messages that are larger than 256 KB in size. The company wants to implement a solution to give the application the ability to parse messages as large as 50 MB. Which solution will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the code? 

A. Use the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java to host messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon S3. 
B. Use Amazon EventBridge to post large messages from the application instead of Amazon SQS. 
C. Change the limit in Amazon SQS to handle messages that are larger than 256 KB. 
D. Store messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Configure Amazon SQS to reference this location in the messages

Amazon SQS has a limit of 256 KB for the size of messages. To handle messages larger than 256 KB, the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java can be used. This library allows messages larger than 256 KB to be stored in Amazon S3 and provides a way to retrieve and process them. Using this solution, the application code can remain largely unchanged while still being able to process messages up to 50 MB in size.
