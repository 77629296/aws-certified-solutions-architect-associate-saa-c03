A company recently deployed a new auditing system to centralize information about operating system versions, patching, and installed software for Amazon EC2 instances. A solutions architect must ensure all instances provisioned through EC2 Auto Scaling groups successfully send reports to the auditing system as soon as they are launched and terminated. Which solution achieves these goals MOST eficiently? 

A. Use a scheduled AWS Lambda function and run a script remotely on all EC2 instances to send data to the audit system. 
B. Use EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks to run a custom script to send data to the audit system when instances are launched and terminated. 
C. Use an EC2 Auto Scaling launch configuration to run a custom script through user data to send data to the audit system when instances are launched and terminated. 
D. Run a custom script on the instance operating system to send data to the audit system. Configure the script to be invoked by the EC2 Auto Scaling group when the instance starts and is terminated.

The most efficient solution for this scenario is to use EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks to run a custom script to send data to the audit system when instances are launched and terminated. The lifecycle hook can be used to delay instance termination until the script has completed, ensuring that all data is sent to the audit system before the instance is terminated. This solution is more efficient than using a scheduled AWS Lambda function, which would require running the function periodically and may not capture all instances launched and terminated within the interval. Running a custom script through user data is also not an optimal solution, as it may not guarantee that all instances send data to the audit system. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
