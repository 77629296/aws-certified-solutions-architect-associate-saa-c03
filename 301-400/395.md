An IAM user made several configuration changes to AWS resources in their company's account during a production deployment last week. A solutions architect learned that a couple of security group rules are not configured as desired. The solutions architect wants to confirm which IAM user was responsible for making changes. Which service should the solutions architect use to find the desired information? 

A. Amazon GuardDuty 
B. Amazon Inspector 
C. AWS CloudTrail 
D. AWS Config

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of AWS account activities. CloudTrail can be used to log all changes made to resources in an AWS account, including changes made by IAM users, EC2 instances, AWS management console, and other AWS services. By using CloudTrail, the solutions architect can identify the IAM user who made the configuration changes to the security group rules.
