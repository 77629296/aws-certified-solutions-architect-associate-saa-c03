A company is experiencing sudden increases in demand. The company needs to provision large Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The instances will run in an Auto Scaling group. The company needs a solution that provides minimum initialization latency to meet the demand. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Use the aws ec2 register-image command to create an AMI from a snapshot. Use AWS Step Functions to replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group. 
B. Enable Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot. Provision an AMI by using the snapshot. Replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group with the new AMI.
C. Enable AMI creation and define lifecycle rules in Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM). Create an AWS Lambda function that modifies the AMI in the Auto Scaling group. 
D. Use Amazon EventBridge to invoke AWS Backup lifecycle policies that provision AMIs. Configure Auto Scaling group capacity limits as an event source in EventBridge.

Enabling Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot allows you to quickly create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from a snapshot, which can help reduce the initialization latency when provisioning new instances. Once the AMI is provisioned, you can replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group with the new AMI. This will ensure that new instances are launched from the updated AMI and are able to meet the increased demand quickly.
