A meteorological startup company has a custom web application to sell weather data to its users online. The company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store its data and wants to build a new service that sends an alert to the managers of four internal teams every time a new weather event is recorded. The company does not want this new service to affect the performance of the current application. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? 

A. Use DynamoDB transactions to write new event data to the table. Condfigure the transactions to notify internal teams. 
B. Have the current application publish a message to four Amazon Simple Notidfication Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Have each team subscribe to one topic. 
C. Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notidfication Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe. 
D. Add a custom attribute to each record to Â­flag new items. Write a cron job that scans the table every minute for items that are new and notidfies an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to which the teams can subscribe
