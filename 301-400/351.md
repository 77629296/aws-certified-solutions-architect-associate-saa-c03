A company is moving its data management application to AWS. The company wants to transition to an event-driven architecture. The architecture needs to be more distributed and to use serverless concepts while performing the different aspects of the work­ flow. The company also wants to minimize operational overhead. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Build out the work­ flow in AWS Glue. Use AWS Glue to invoke AWS Lambda functions to process the work­ flow steps. 
B. Build out the work­ flow in AWS Step Functions. Deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances. Use Step Functions to invoke the work­ flow steps on the EC2 instances. 
C. Build out the work­ flow in Amazon EventBridge. Use EventBridge to invoke AWS Lambda functions on a schedule to process the work­ flow steps. 
D. Build out the work­ flow in AWS Step Functions. Use Step Functions to create a state machine. Use the state machine to invoke AWS Lambda functions to process the work­ flow steps

AWS Step functions is serverless Visual workflows for distributed applications
