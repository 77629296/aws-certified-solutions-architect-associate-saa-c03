An ecommerce company is building a distributed application that involves several serverless functions and AWS services to complete order- processing tasks. These tasks require manual approvals as part of the workÂ­ flow. A solutions architect needs to design an architecture for the order-processing application. The solution must be able to combine multiple AWS Lambda functions into responsive serverless applications. The solution also must orchestrate data and services that run on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or on-premises servers. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use AWS Step Functions to build the application. 
B. Integrate all the application components in an AWS Glue job. 
C. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to build the application. 
D. Use AWS Lambda functions and Amazon EventBridge events to build the application.

AWS Step Functions is a fully managed service that makes it easy to build applications by coordinating the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. With Step Functions, you can combine multiple AWS Lambda functions into responsive serverless applications and orchestrate data and services that run on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or on-premises servers. Step Functions also allows for manual approvals as part of the workflow. This solution meets all the requirements with the least operational overhead.
