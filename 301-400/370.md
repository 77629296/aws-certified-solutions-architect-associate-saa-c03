A company runs a public three-tier web application in a VPC. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances that run in private subnets need to communicate with a license server over the internet. The company needs a managed solution that minimizes operational maintenance. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Provision a NAT instance in a public subnet. Modify each private subnet's route table with a default route that points to the NAT instance. 
B. Provision a NAT instance in a private subnet. Modify each private subnet's route table with a default route that points to the NAT instance. 
C. Provision a NAT gateway in a public subnet. Modify each private subnet's route table with a default route that points to the NAT gateway. 
D. Provision a NAT gateway in a private subnet. Modify each private subnet's route table with a default route that points to the NAT gateway.

NAT instances (A, B) require more hands-on management.
NAT gateway provides automatic scaling, high availability, and fully managed service without admin overhead. Placing the NAT gateway in a public subnet with proper routes allows private instances to use it for internet access. Minimal operational maintenance compared to NAT instances.
