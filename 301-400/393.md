A payment processing company records all voice communication with its customers and stores the audio files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company needs to capture the text from the audio files. The company must remove from the text any personally identifiable information (PII) that belongs to customers. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Process the audio files by using Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Use an AWS Lambda function to scan for known PII patterns. 
B. When an audio file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, invoke an AWS Lambda function to start an Amazon Textract task to analyze the call recordings.
C. Configure an Amazon Transcribe transcription job with PII redaction turned on. When an audio file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, invoke an AWS Lambda function to start the transcription job. Store the output in a separate S3 bucket. 
D. Create an Amazon Connect contact ­flow that ingests the audio files with transcription turned on. Embed an AWS Lambda function to scan for known PII patterns. Use Amazon EventBridge to start the contact ­ ow when an audio file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

Amazon Transcribe is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that converts speech to text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology
