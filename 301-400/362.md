A company uses a payment processing system that requires messages for a particular payment ID to be received in the same order that they were sent. Otherwise, the payments might be processed incorrectly. Which actions should a solutions architect take to meet this requirement? (Choose two.) 

A. Write the messages to an Amazon DynamoDB table with the payment ID as the partition key. 
B. Write the messages to an Amazon Kinesis data stream with the payment ID as the partition key. 
C. Write the messages to an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster with the payment ID as the key. 
D. Write the messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Set the message attribute to use the payment ID. 
E. Write the messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Set the message group to use the payment ID.

SQS FIFO queues guarantee that messages are received in the exact order they are sent. Using the payment ID as the message group ensures all messages for a payment ID are received sequentially. 
Kinesis data streams can also enforce ordering on a per partition key basis. Using the payment ID as the partition key will ensure strict ordering of messages for each payment ID.
