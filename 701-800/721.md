A company wants to rearchitect a large-scale web application to a serverless microservices architecture. The application uses Amazon EC2 instances and is written in Python. The company selected one component of the web application to test as a microservice. The component supports hundreds of requests each second. The company wants to create and test the microservice on an AWS solution that supports Python. The solution must also scale automatically and require minimal infrastructure and minimal operational support. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use a Spot Fleet with auto scaling of EC2 instances that run the most recent Amazon Linux operating system. 
B. Use an AWS Elastic Beanstalk web server environment that has high availability configured. 
C. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Launch Auto Scaling groups of self-managed EC2 instances. 
D. Use an AWS Lambda function that runs custom developed code.
