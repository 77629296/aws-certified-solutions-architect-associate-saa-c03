A company is using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to present its application to the internet. The company finds abnormal traffic access patterns across the application. A solutions architect needs to improve visibility into the infrastructure to help the company understand these abnormalities better. What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements? 

A. Create a table in Amazon Athena for AWS CloudTrail logs. Create a query for the relevant information. 
B. Enable ALB access logging to Amazon S3. Create a table in Amazon Athena, and query the logs. 
C. Enable ALB access logging to Amazon S3. Open each file in a text editor, and search each line for the relevant information. 
D. Use Amazon EMR on a dedicated Amazon EC2 instance to directly query the ALB to acquire traffic access log information.
