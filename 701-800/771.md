A company stores data in an on-premises Oracle relational database. The company needs to make the data available in Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL for analysis. The company uses an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to connect its on-premises network to AWS. The company must capture the changes that occur to the source database during the migration to Aurora PostgreSQL. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert the Oracle schema to Aurora PostgreSQL schema. Use the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) full-load migration task to migrate the data. 
B. Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Import the S3 data to Aurora PostgreSQL by using the Aurora PostgreSQL aws_s3 extension. 
C. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert the Oracle schema to Aurora PostgreSQL schema. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the existing data and replicate the ongoing changes. 
D. Use an AWS Snowball device to migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Import the S3 data to Aurora PostgreSQL by using the Aurora PostgreSQL aws_s3 extension.
