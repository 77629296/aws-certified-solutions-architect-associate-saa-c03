A company is running a legacy system on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application code cannot be modified, and the system cannot run on more than one instance. A solutions architect must design a resilient solution that can improve the recovery time for the system. What should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 

A. Enable termination protection for the EC2 instance. 
B. Configure the EC2 instance for Multi-AZ deployment. 
C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover the EC2 instance in case of failure. 
D. Launch the EC2 instance with two Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that use RAID configurations for storage redundancy.
