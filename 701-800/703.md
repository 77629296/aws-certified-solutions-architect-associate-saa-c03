A company has NFS servers in an on-premises data center that need to periodically back up small amounts of data to Amazon S3. Which solution meets these requirements and is MOST cost-effective? 

A. Set up AWS Glue to copy the data from the on-premises servers to Amazon S3. 
B. Set up an AWS DataSync agent on the on-premises servers, and sync the data to Amazon S3. 
C. Set up an SFTP sync using AWS Transfer for SFTP to sync data from on premises to Amazon S3. 
D. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises data center and a VPC, and copy the data to Amazon S3.

A -> Used for ETL not copying 
B -> Works 
C -> Works, but overkill for the described scenario of periodic small backups, high cost 
D -> Works but it may not be necessary for transferring small amounts of data periodically. High setup cost
