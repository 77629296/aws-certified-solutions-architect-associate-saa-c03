A company has multiple AWS accounts with applications deployed in the us-west-2 Region. Application logs are stored within Amazon S3 buckets in each account. The company wants to build a centralized log analysis solution that uses a single S3 bucket. Logs must not leave us- west-2, and the company wants to incur minimal operational overhead. Which solution meets these requirements and is MOST cost-effective? 

A. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy that copies the objects from one of the application S3 buckets to the centralized S3 bucket. 
B. Use S3 Same-Region Replication to replicate logs from the S3 buckets to another S3 bucket in us-west-2. Use this S3 bucket for log analysis. 
C. Write a script that uses the PutObject API operation every day to copy the entire contents of the buckets to another S3 bucket in us- west-2. Use this S3 bucket for log analysis. 
D. Write AWS Lambda functions in these accounts that are triggered every time logs are delivered to the S3 buckets (s3:ObjectCreated:* event). Copy the logs to another S3 bucket in us-west-2. Use this S3 bucket for log analysis.
