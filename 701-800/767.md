A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug. The volume of data that the company generates has grown exponentially over the past few months. The company's researchers regularly require a subset of the entire dataset to be immediately available with minimal lag. However, the entire dataset does not need to be accessed on a daily basis. All the data currently resides in on-premises storage arrays, and the company wants to reduce ongoing capital expenses. Which storage solution should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 

A. Run AWS DataSync as a scheduled cron job to migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket on an ongoing basis. 
B. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway with an Amazon S3 bucket as the target storage. Migrate the data to the Storage Gateway appliance. 
C. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway with cached volumes with an Amazon S3 bucket as the target storage. Migrate the data to the Storage Gateway appliance. 
D. Configure an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection from the on-premises environment to AWS. Migrate data to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.
