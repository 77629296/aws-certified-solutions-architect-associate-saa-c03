A company has a multi-tier payment processing application that is based on virtual machines (VMs). The communication between the tiers occurs asynchronously through a third-party middleware solution that guarantees exactly-once delivery. The company needs a solution that requires the least amount of infrastructure management. The solution must guarantee exactly-once delivery for application messaging. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Use AWS Lambda for the compute layers in the architecture. 
B. Use Amazon EC2 instances for the compute layers in the architecture. 
C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) as the messaging component between the compute layers. 
D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the messaging component between the compute layers. 
E. Use containers that are based on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for the compute layers in the architecture
