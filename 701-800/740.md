A company migrated millions of archival files to Amazon S3. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution that will encrypt all the archival data by using a customer-provided key. The solution must encrypt existing unencrypted objects and future objects. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering an Amazon S3 Inventory report. Configure an S3 Batch Operations job to encrypt the objects from the list with a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C). Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C). 
B. Use S3 Storage Lens metrics to identify unencrypted S3 buckets. Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). 
C. Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering the AWS usage report for Amazon S3. Configure an AWS Batch job to encrypt the objects from the list with a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). 
D. Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering the AWS usage report for Amazon S3. Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C)
