A company is developing a mobile game that streams score updates to a backend processor and then posts results on a leaderboard. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that can handle large trafic spikes, process the mobile game updates in order of receipt, and store the processed updates in a highly available database. The company also wants to minimize the management overhead required to maintain the solution. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Push score updates to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Process the updates in Kinesis Data Streams with AWS Lambda. Store the processed updates in Amazon DynamoDB. 
B. Push score updates to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Process the updates with a ­fleet of Amazon EC2 instances set up for Auto Scaling. Store the processed updates in Amazon Redshift. 
C. Push score updates to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the SNS topic to process the updates. Store the processed updates in a SQL database running on Amazon EC2. 
D. Push score updates to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use a ­ eet of Amazon EC2 instances with Auto Scaling to process the updates in the SQS queue. Store the processed updates in an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance.
