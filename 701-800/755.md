A companyâ€™s data platform uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. The database has multiple read replicas and multiple DB instances across different Availability Zones. Users have recently reported errors from the database that indicate that there are too many connections. The company wants to reduce the failover time by 20% when a read replica is promoted to primary writer. Which solution will meet this requirement? 

A. Switch from Aurora to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ cluster deployment. 
B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy in front of the Aurora database. 
C. Switch to Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read connections. 
D. Switch to Amazon Redshift with relocation capability.
