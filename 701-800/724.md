A company runs container applications by using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. The workload is not consistent throughout the day. A solutions architect notices that the number of nodes does not automatically scale out when the existing nodes have reached maximum capacity in the cluster, which causes performance issues. Which solution will resolve this issue with the LEAST administrative overhead? 

A. Scale out the nodes by tracking the memory usage. 
B. Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to manage the number of nodes in the cluster. 
C. Use an AWS Lambda function to resize the EKS cluster automatically. 
D. Use an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to distribute the workload.
