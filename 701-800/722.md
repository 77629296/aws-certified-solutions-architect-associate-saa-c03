A company has an AWS Direct Connect connection from its on-premises location to an AWS account. The AWS account has 30 different VPCs in the same AWS Region. The VPCs use private virtual interfaces (VIFs). Each VPC has a CIDR block that does not overlap with other networks under the company's control. The company wants to centrally manage the networking architecture while still allowing each VPC to communicate with all other VPCs and on- premises networks. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? 

A. Create a transit gateway, and associate the Direct Connect connection with a new transit VIF. Turn on the transit gateway's route propagation feature. 
B. Create a Direct Connect gateway. Recreate the private VIFs to use the new gateway. Associate each VPC by creating new virtual private gateways. 
C. Create a transit VPConnect the Direct Connect connection to the transit VPCreate a peering connection between all other VPCs in the Region. Update the route tables. 
D. Create AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections from on premises to each VPC. Ensure that both VPN tunnels are UP for each connection. Turn on the route propagation feature.
