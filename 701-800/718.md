A companyâ€™s applications use Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark to process data on premises. The existing infrastructure is not scalable and is complex to manage. A solutions architect must design a scalable solution that reduces operational complexity. The solution must keep the data processing on premises. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN to access the on-premises Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) data and application. Use an Amazon EMR cluster to process the data. 
B. Use AWS DataSync to connect to the on-premises Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to process the data. 
C. Migrate the Apache Hadoop application and the Apache Spark application to Amazon EMR clusters on AWS Outposts. Use the EMR clusters to process the data. 
D. Use an AWS Snowball device to migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to process the data.
