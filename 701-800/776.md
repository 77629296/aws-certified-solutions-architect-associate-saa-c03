A company has a mobile game that reads most of its metadata from an Amazon RDS DB instance. As the game increased in popularity, developers noticed slowdowns related to the game's metadata load times. Performance metrics indicate that simply scaling the database will not help. A solutions architect must explore all options that include capabilities for snapshots, replication, and sub-millisecond response times. What should the solutions architect recommend to solve these issues? 

A. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora with Aurora Replicas. 
B. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB with global tables. 
C. Add an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis layer in front of the database. 
D. Add an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached layer in front of the database.
