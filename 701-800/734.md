A company has an AWS Direct Connect connection from its corporate data center to its VPC in the us-east-1 Region. The company recently acquired a corporation that has several VPCs and a Direct Connect connection between its on-premises data center and the eu-west-2 Region. The CIDR blocks for the VPCs of the company and the corporation do not overlap. The company requires connectivity between two Regions and the data centers. The company needs a solution that is scalable while reducing operational overhead. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
A. Set up inter-Region VPC peering between the VPC in us-east-1 and the VPCs in eu-west-2. 
B. Create private virtual interfaces from the Direct Connect connection in us-east-1 to the VPCs in eu-west-2. 
C. Establish VPN appliances in a fully meshed VPN network hosted by Amazon EC2. Use AWS VPN CloudHub to send and receive data between the data centers and each VPC. 
D. Connect the existing Direct Connect connection to a Direct Connect gateway. Route trafic from the virtual private gateways of the VPCs in each Region to the Direct Connect gateway
