A company wants to deploy its containerized application workloads to a VPC across three Availability Zones. The company needs a solution that is highly available across Availability Zones. The solution must require minimal changes to the application. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling to use target tracking scaling. Set the minimum capacity to 3. Set the task placement strategy type to spread with an Availability Zone attribute. 
B. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) self-managed nodes. Configure Application Auto Scaling to use target tracking scaling. Set the minimum capacity to 3. 
C. Use Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Launch three EC2 instances in a spread placement group. Configure an Auto Scaling group to use target tracking scaling. Set the minimum capacity to 3. 
D. Use an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to connect to a VPC. Configure Application Auto Scaling to use Lambda as a scalable target. Set the minimum capacity to 3.

Amazon EKS self-managed nodes require you to manually install and configure the Kubernetes node components, such as kubelet, kube-proxy, and Docker, on your Amazon EC2 instances. You also need to manage the security group, IAM role, and subnet for your node group. Amazon ECS handles these tasks for you when you use the Amazon EC2 launch type .
