A company is designing a web application on AWS. The application will use a VPN connection between the companyâ€™s existing data centers and the company's VPCs. The company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS service. The application must use private DNS records to communicate with the on-premises services from a VPC. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure manner? 

A. Create a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC. 
B. Create a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC. 
C. Create a Route 53 private hosted zone. Associate the private hosted zone with the VPC. 
D. Create a Route 53 public hosted zone. Create a record for each service to allow service communication

Inbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries to your VPC from your on-premises network or another VPC. 
Outbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries from your VPC to your on-premises network or another VPC.
