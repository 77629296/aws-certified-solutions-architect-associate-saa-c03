A company has a new mobile app. Anywhere in the world, users can see local news on topics they choose. Users also can post photos and videos from inside the app. Users access content often in the first minutes after the content is posted. New content quickly replaces older content, and then the older content disappears. The local nature of the news means that users consume 90% of the content within the AWS Region where it is uploaded. Which solution will optimize the user experience by providing the LOWEST latency for content uploads? 

A. Upload and store content in Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudFront for the uploads. 
B. Upload and store content in Amazon S3. Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for the uploads. 
C. Upload content to Amazon EC2 instances in the Region that is closest to the user. Copy the data to Amazon S3. 
D. Upload and store content in Amazon S3 in the Region that is closest to the user. Use multiple distributions of Amazon CloudFront
