A company's web application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud recently increased in popularity. The web application currently exists on a single Amazon EC2 instance in a single public subnet. The web application has not been able to meet the demand of the increased web traffic. The company needs a solution that will provide high availability and scalability to meet the increased user demand without rewriting the web application. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Replace the EC2 instance with a larger compute optimized instance. 
B. Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with multiple Availability Zones in private subnets. 
C. Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet to handle web requests. 
D. Replace the EC2 instance with a larger memory optimized instance. 
E. Configure an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet to distribute web traffic.
