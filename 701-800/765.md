A development team is collaborating with another company to create an integrated product. The other company needs to access an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue that is contained in the development team's account. The other company wants to poll the queue without giving up its own account permissions to do so. How should a solutions architect provide access to the SQS queue? 

A. Create an instance profile that provides the other company access to the SQS queue. 
B. Create an IAM policy that provides the other company access to the SQS queue. 
C. Create an SQS access policy that provides the other company access to the SQS queue. 
D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) access policy that provides the other company access to the SQS queue.

By creating an SQS access policy, you can define specific permissions for the other company to access the SQS queue without requiring them to modify their own account permissions. This allows for fine-grained control over access to the queue while maintaining security and isolation between accounts.
