A company hosts its multi-tier applications on AWS. For compliance, governance, auditing, and security, the company must track configuration changes on its AWS resources and record a history of API calls made to these resources. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and AWS Config to record API calls. 

B. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and AWS CloudTrail to record API calls. 

C. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls. 

D. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls

Explain:
AWS Config for Configuration Changes: AWS Config is a service that tracks changes to resource configurations over time. It provides a history of configuration changes to your AWS resources and helps with compliance and auditing by allowing you to assess how resource configurations have changed over time. 
AWS CloudTrail for API Calls: AWS CloudTrail is designed specifically for recording API calls made to AWS resources. It captures detailed information about who made each API call, the actions taken, and the resources affected. This is essential for auditing and security purposes.
