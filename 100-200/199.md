A telemarketing company is designing its customer call center functionality on AWS. The company needs a solution that provides multiple speaker recognition and generates transcript files. The company wants to query the transcript files to analyze the business patterns. The transcript files must be stored for 7 years for auditing purposes. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use Amazon Rekognition for multiple speaker recognition. Store the transcript files in Amazon S3. Use machine learning models for transcript file analysis. 

B. Use Amazon Transcribe for multiple speaker recognition. Use Amazon Athena for transcript file analysis. 

C. Use Amazon Translate for multiple speaker recognition. Store the transcript files in Amazon Redshift. Use SQL queries for transcript file analysis. 

D. Use Amazon Rekognition for multiple speaker recognition. Store the transcript files in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Textract for transcript file analysis.

Amazon Transcribe is a service that automatically transcribes spoken language into written text. It can handle multiple speakers and can generate transcript files in real-time or asynchronously. These transcript files can be stored in Amazon S3 for long-term storage. 
Amazon Athena is a query service that allows you to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL. You can use it to analyze the transcript files and identify patterns in the data.

Option A is incorrect because Amazon Rekognition is a service for analyzing images and videos, not transcribing spoken language. 
Option C is incorrect because Amazon Translate is a service for translating text from one language to another, not transcribing spoken language. 
Option D is incorrect because Amazon Textract is a service for extracting text and data from documents and images, not transcribing spoken language.
