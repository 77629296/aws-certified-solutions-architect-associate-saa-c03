A company has an AWS account used for software engineering. The AWS account has access to the company’s on-premises data center through a pair of AWS Direct Connect connections. All non-VPC trafic routes to the virtual private gateway. A development team recently created an AWS Lambda function through the console. The development team needs to allow the function to access a database that runs in a private subnet in the company’s data center. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure the Lambda function to run in the VPC with the appropriate security group. 

B. Set up a VPN connection from AWS to the data center. Route the trafic from the Lambda function through the VPN. 

C. Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect. 

D. Create an Elastic IP address. Configure the Lambda function to send trafic through the Elastic IP address without an elastic network interface
