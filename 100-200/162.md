A company wants to use high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure on AWS for financial risk modeling. The company’s HPC workloads run on Linux. Each HPC work­ flow runs on hundreds of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, is short-lived, and generates thousands of output files that are ultimately stored in persistent storage for analytics and long-term future use. The company seeks a cloud storage solution that permits the copying of on-premises data to long-term persistent storage to make data available for processing by all EC2 instances. The solution should also be a high performance file system that is integrated with persistent storage to read and write datasets and output files. Which combination of AWS services meets these requirements? 

A. Amazon FSx for Lustre integrated with Amazon S3 

B. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server integrated with Amazon S3 

C. Amazon S3 Glacier integrated with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) 

D. Amazon S3 bucket with a VPC endpoint integrated with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume
