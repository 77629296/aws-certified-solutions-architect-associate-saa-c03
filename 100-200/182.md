Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Create an Amazon RDS DB instance with synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones. 

B. Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data. 

C. Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and then create a read replica in a separate AWS Region that synchronously replicates the data. 

D. Create an Amazon EC2 instance with a MySQL engine installed that triggers an AWS Lambda function to synchronously replicate the data to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance.
