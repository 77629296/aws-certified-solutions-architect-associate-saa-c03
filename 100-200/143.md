A company wants to migrate its existing on-premises monolithic application to AWS. The company wants to keep as much of the front-end code and the backend code as possible. However, the company wants to break the application into smaller applications. A different team will manage each application. The company needs a highly scalable solution that minimizes operational overhead. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Host the application on AWS Lambda. Integrate the application with Amazon API Gateway. 

B. Host the application with AWS Amplify. Connect the application to an Amazon API Gateway API that is integrated with AWS Lambda. 

C. Host the application on Amazon EC2 instances. Set up an Application Load Balancer with EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group as targets. 

D. Host the application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Set up an Application Load Balancer with Amazon ECS as the target

Explain:
ECS provides a highly scalable and managed environment for running containerized applications, reducing operational overhead. By setting up an ALB with ECS as the target, traffic can be distributed across multiple instances of the application for scalability and availability. This solution enables different teams to manage each application independently, promoting team autonomy and efficient development.
