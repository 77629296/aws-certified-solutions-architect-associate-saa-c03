An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zonas. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. The application performs best when the CPU utilization of the EC2 instances is at or near 40%. What should a solutions architect do to maintain the desired performance across all instances in the group? 

A. Use a simple scaling policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group. 

B. Use a target tracking policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group. 

C. Use an AWS Lambda function ta update the desired Auto Scaling group capacity. 

D. Use scheduled scaling actions to scale up and scale down the Auto Scaling group

Explain:
A target tracking policy allows the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in the group based on a target value for a metric. In this case, the target value for the CPU utilization metric could be set to 40% to maintain the desired performance of the application. The Auto Scaling group would then automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed to maintain the target value for the metric.
