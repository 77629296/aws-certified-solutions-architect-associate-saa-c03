A company has a dynamic web application hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances. The company has its own SSL certificate, which is on each instance to perform SSL termination. There has been an increase in trafic recently, and the operations team determined that SSL encryption and decryption is causing the compute capacity of the web servers to reach their maximum limit. What should a solutions architect do to increase the application's performance? 

A. Create a new SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Install the ACM certificate on each instance. 

B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket Migrate the SSL certificate to the S3 bucket. Configure the EC2 instances to reference the bucket for SSL termination. 

C. Create another EC2 instance as a proxy server. Migrate the SSL certificate to the new instance and configure it to direct connections to the existing EC2 instances. 

D. Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.
