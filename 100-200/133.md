A company runs an Oracle database on premises. As part of the companyâ€™s migration to AWS, the company wants to upgrade the database to the most recent available version. The company also wants to set up disaster recovery (DR) for the database. The company needs to minimize the operational overhead for normal operations and DR setup. The company also needs to maintain access to the database's underlying operating system. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Migrate the Oracle database to an Amazon EC2 instance. Set up database replication to a different AWS Region. 

B. Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. Activate Cross-Region automated backups to replicate the snapshots to another AWS Region. 

C. Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. Create a read replica for the database in another AWS Region. 

D. Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. Create a standby database in another Availability Zone.

Explain:
Option C since RDS Custom has access to the underlying OS and it provides less operational overhead. Also, a read replica in another Region can be used for DR activities.
