A company needs to run a critical application on AWS. The company needs to use Amazon EC2 for the applicationâ€™s database. The database must be highly available and must fail over automatically if a disruptive event occurs. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Launch two EC2 instances, each in a different Availability Zone in the same AWS Region. Install the database on both EC2 instances. Configure the EC2 instances as a cluster. Set up database replication. 
B. Launch an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone. Install the database on the EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to back up the data. Use AWS CloudFormation to automate provisioning of the EC2 instance if a disruptive event occurs. 
C. Launch two EC2 instances, each in a different AWS Region. Install the database on both EC2 instances. Set up database replication. Fail over the database to a second Region. 
D. Launch an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone. Install the database on the EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to back up the data. Use EC2 automatic recovery to recover the instance if a disruptive event occurs.
