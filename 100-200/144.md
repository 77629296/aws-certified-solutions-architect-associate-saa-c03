A company recently started using Amazon Aurora as the data store for its global ecommerce application. When large reports are run, developers report that the ecommerce application is performing poorly. After reviewing metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, a solutions architect finds that the ReadIOPS and CPUUtilizalion metrics are spiking when monthly reports run. What is the MOST cost-effective solution? 

A. Migrate the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift. 

B. Migrate the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica. 

C. Migrate the Aurora database to a larger instance class. 

D. Increase the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance

Explain:
Migrating the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica may be the most cost-effective solution because it involves creating a read-only copy of the database that can be used specifically for running large reports without impacting the performance of the primary database. This solution allows the company to scale the read capacity of the database without incurring additional hardware or I/O costs
