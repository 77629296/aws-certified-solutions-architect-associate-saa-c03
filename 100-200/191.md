A company has an ordering application that stores customer information in Amazon RDS for MySQL. During regular business hours, employees run one-time queries for reporting purposes. Timeouts are occurring during order processing because the reporting queries are taking a long time to run. The company needs to eliminate the timeouts without preventing employees from performing queries. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Create a read replica. Move reporting queries to the read replica.

B. Create a read replica. Distribute the ordering application to the primary DB instance and the read replica. 

C. Migrate the ordering application to Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand capacity. 

D. Schedule the reporting queries for non-peak hours.
