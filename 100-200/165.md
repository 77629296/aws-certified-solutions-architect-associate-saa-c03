A solutions architect must design a solution that uses Amazon CloudFront with an Amazon S3 origin to store a static website. The companyâ€™s security policy requires that all website trafic be inspected by AWS WAF. How should the solutions architect comply with these requirements? 

A. Configure an S3 bucket policy to accept requests coming from the AWS WAF Amazon Resource Name (ARN) only. 

B. Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward all incoming requests to AWS WAF before requesting content from the S3 origin. 

C. Configure a security group that allows Amazon CloudFront IP addresses to access Amazon S3 only. Associate AWS WAF to CloudFront. 

D. Configure Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 to use an origin access identity (OAI) to restrict access to the S3 bucket. Enable AWS WAF on the distribution.
