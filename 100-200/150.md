A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization increases to more than 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.

B. Create Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the metrics and react to issues quickly. 

C. Create Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries to monitor the application and raise an alarm. 

D. Create single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where possible.
