A global company is using Amazon API Gateway to design REST APIs for its loyalty club users in the us-east-1 Region and the ap-southeast-2 Region. A solutions architect must design a solution to protect these API Gateway managed REST APIs across multiple accounts from SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort? 

A. Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage. 

B. Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules. 

C. Set up AWS Shield in bath Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage. 

D. Set up AWS Shield in one of the Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.

Explain:
B. By setting up AWS Firewall Manager, you can centrally configure AWS WAF rules, which can be applied to multiple AWS accounts and Regions. This allows for efficient management and enforcement of security rules across accounts without the need for separate configuration in each individual Region. 

Option A (Setting up AWS WAF with Regional web ACLs) requires setting up and managing AWS WAF in each Region separately, which increases administrative effort. 

Option C (Setting up AWS Shield with Regional web ACLs) primarily focuses on DDoS protection and may not provide the same level of protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks as AWS WAF. 

Option D (Setting up AWS Shield in one Region) provides DDoS protection but does not directly address protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
