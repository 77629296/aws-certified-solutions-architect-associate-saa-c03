A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website. The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally eficient process for image uploads. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier. 

B. Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3. 

C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL 

D. Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image. 

E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images
