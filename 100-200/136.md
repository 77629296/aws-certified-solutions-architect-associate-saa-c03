A company is migrating its on-premises PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The on-premises database must remain online and accessible during the migration. The Aurora database must remain synchronized with the on-premises database. Which combination of actions must a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Create an ongoing replication task. 

B. Create a database backup of the on-premises database. 

C. Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) replication server. 

D. Convert the database schema by using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT). 

E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to monitor the database synchronization.

Explain:
An ongoing DMS replication task keeps the source and target databases synchronized during the migration. 
The DMS replication server manages and executes the replication tasks. 
Together, these will continuously replicate changes from on-prem to Aurora to keep them in sync. A database backup alone wouldn't maintain synchronization.
