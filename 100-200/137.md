A company uses AWS Organizations to create dedicated AWS accounts for each business unit to manage each business unit's account independently upon request. The root email recipient missed a notification that was sent to the root user email address of one account. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications are not missed. Future notifications must be limited to account administrators. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure the company’s email server to forward notification email messages that are sent to the AWS account root user email address to all users in the organization. 

B. Configure all AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that go to a few administrators who can respond to alerts. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically. 

C. Configure all AWS account root user email messages to be sent to one administrator who is responsible for monitoring alerts and forwarding those alerts to the appropriate groups.

D. Con¬ gure all existing AWS accounts and all newly created accounts to use the same root user email address. Con¬ gure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.
