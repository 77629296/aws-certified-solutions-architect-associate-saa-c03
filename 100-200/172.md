A solutions architect is creating a new Amazon CloudFront distribution for an application. Some of the information submitted by users is sensitive. The application uses HTTPS but needs another layer of security. The sensitive information should be protected throughout the entire application stack, and access to the information should be restricted to certain applications. Which action should the solutions architect take? 

A. Configure a CloudFront signed URL. 
B. Configure a CloudFront signed cookie. 
C. Configure a CloudFront field-level encryption profile. 
D. Configure CloudFront and set the Origin Protocol Policy setting to HTTPS Only for the Viewer Protocol Policy.

Field-level encryption allows you to enable your users to securely upload sensitive information to your web servers. The sensitive information provided by your users is encrypted at the edge, close to the user, and remains encrypted throughout your entire application stack. This encryption ensures that only applications that need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do so.
