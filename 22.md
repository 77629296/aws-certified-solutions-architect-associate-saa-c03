A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files. Which storage option meets these requirements? 

A. S3 Standard 
B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering 
C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 
D. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

Explain:
Keywords:
- Must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone.
- files are accessed FREQUENTLY while other files are RARELY accessed in an UNPREDICTABLE pattern. 

A - Incorrect: S3 Standard is not cost effective for rarely access files 
B - Correct: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is good for file which frequently or rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. Intelligent-Tiering will help us analyze the pattern and move rarely access files to storage which has lower cost. 
C - Incorrect: Standard-Infrequent Access is not cost effective for frequently access files 
D - Incorrect: One Zone-Infrequent Access is not resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone
