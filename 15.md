A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the trafic that flows in and out of the production VPC. The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as trafic Â­flow inspection and trafic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use Amazon GuardDuty for trafic inspection and trafic filtering in the production VPC. 

B. Use Trafic Mirroring to mirror trafic from the production VPC for trafic inspection and filtering. 

C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for trafic inspection and trafic filtering for the production VPC. 

D. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for trafic inspection and trafic filtering for the production VPC.
