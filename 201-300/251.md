An Amazon EC2 instance is located in a private subnet in a new VPC. This subnet does not have outbound internet access, but the EC2 instance needs the ability to download monthly security updates from an outside vendor. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route. 
B. Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route. 
C. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT instance as the default route. 
D. Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route

This approach will allow the EC2 instance to access the internet and download the monthly security updates while still being located in a private subnet. By creating a NAT gateway and placing it in a public subnet, it will allow the instances in the private subnet to access the internet through the NAT gateway. And then, configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route. This will ensure that all outbound traffic is directed through the NAT gateway, allowing the EC2 instance to access the internet while still maintaining the security of the private subnet.
