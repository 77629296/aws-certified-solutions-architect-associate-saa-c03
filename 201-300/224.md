A company recently migrated its web application to AWS by rehosting the application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single AWS Region. The company wants to redesign its application architecture to be highly available and fault tolerant. Trafic must reach all running EC2 instances randomly. Which combination of steps should the company take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Create an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy. 
B. Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy. 
C. Create an Amazon Route 53 multivalue answer routing policy. 
D. Launch three EC2 instances: two instances in one Availability Zone and one instance in another Availability Zone. 
E. Launch four EC2 instances: two instances in one Availability Zone and two instances in another Availability Zone.

C. A multivalue answer routing policy in Route 53 allows you to configure multiple values for a DNS record, and Route 53 responds to DNS queries with multiple random values. This enables the distribution of traffic randomly among the available EC2 instances. E. By launching EC2 instances in different AZs, you achieve high availability and fault tolerance. Launching four instances (two in each AZ) ensures that there are enough resources to handle the traffic load and maintain the desired level of availability.
