Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally eficient way? 

A. Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS Lambda and custom scripts. 
B. Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS CloudFormation. 
C. Launch EC2 instances in a secondary AWS Region. Keep the EC2 instances in the secondary Region active at all times. 
D. Launch EC2 instances in a secondary Availability Zone. Keep the EC2 instances in the secondary Availability Zone active at all times.
