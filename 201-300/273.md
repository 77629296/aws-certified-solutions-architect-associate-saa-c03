A rapidly growing ecommerce company is running its workloads in a single AWS Region. A solutions architect must create a disaster recovery (DR) strategy that includes a different AWS Region. The company wants its database to be up to date in the DR Region with the least possible latency. The remaining infrastructure in the DR Region needs to run at reduced capacity and must be able to scale up if necessary. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LOWEST recovery time objective (RTO)? 

A. Use an Amazon Aurora global database with a pilot light deployment. 
B. Use an Amazon Aurora global database with a warm standby deployment. 
C. Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance with a pilot light deployment. 
D. Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance with a warm standby deployment.

Option A is incorrect because while Amazon Aurora global database is a good solution for disaster recovery, pilot light deployment provides only a minimalistic setup and would require manual intervention to make the DR Region fully operational, which increases the recovery time. 
Option B is a better choice than Option A as it provides a warm standby deployment, which is an automated and more scalable setup than pilot light deployment. In this setup, the database is replicated to the DR Region, and the standby instance can be brought up quickly in case of a disaster. 
Option C is incorrect because Multi-AZ DB instances provide high availability, not disaster recovery. 
Option D is a good choice for high availability, but it does not meet the requirement for DR in a different region with the least possible latency.
