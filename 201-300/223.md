Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to accomplish this goal? (Choose two.) 

A. Attach an IAM role that has suficient privileges to the EKS pod. 
B. Attach an IAM user that has suficient privileges to the EKS pod. 
C. Allow outbound connectivity to the DynamoDB table through the private subnetsâ€™ network ACLs. 
D. Create a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB. 
E. Embed the access keys in the Java Spring Boot code.
