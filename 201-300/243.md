A medical research lab produces data that is related to a new study. The lab wants to make the data available with minimum latency to clinics across the country for their on-premises, file-based applications. The data files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that has read-only permissions for each clinic. What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 

A. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on premises at each clinic 
B. Migrate the files to each clinic’s on-premises applications by using AWS DataSync for processing. 
C. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on premises at each clinic. 
D. Attach an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to each clinic’s on-premises servers.
