A company has a web application hosted over 10 Amazon EC2 instances with trafic directed by Amazon Route 53. The company occasionally experiences a timeout error when attempting to browse the application. The networking team finds that some DNS queries return IP addresses of unhealthy instances, resulting in the timeout error. What should a solutions architect implement to overcome these timeout errors? 

A. Create a Route 53 simple routing policy record for each EC2 instance. Associate a health check with each record. 
B. Create a Route 53 failover routing policy record for each EC2 instance. Associate a health check with each record. 
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with EC2 instances as its origin. Associate a health check with the EC2 instances. 
D. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a health check in front of the EC2 instances. Route to the ALB from Route 53.
