A solutions architect needs to design a new microservice for a companyâ€™s application. Clients must be able to call an HTTPS endpoint to reach the microservice. The microservice also must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authenticate calls. The solutions architect will write the logic for this microservice by using a single AWS Lambda function that is written in Go 1.x. Which solution will deploy the function in the MOST operationally eficient way? 

A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API.
B. Create a Lambda function URL for the function. Specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type. 
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy the function to Lambda@Edge. Integrate IAM authentication logic into the Lambda@Edge function. 
D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy the function to CloudFront Functions. Specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type

A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API. This option is the most operationally efficient as it allows you to use API Gateway to handle the HTTPS endpoint and also allows you to use IAM to authenticate the calls to the microservice. API Gateway also provides many additional features such as caching, throttling, and monitoring, which can be useful for a microservice.
