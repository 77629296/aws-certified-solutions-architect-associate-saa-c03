A company has deployed a database in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Due to increased transactions, the database support team is reporting slow reads against the DB instance and recommends adding a read replica. Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take before implementing this change? (Choose two.) 
A. Enable binlog replication on the RDS primary node. 
B. Choose a failover priority for the source DB instance. 
C. Allow long-running transactions to complete on the source DB instance. 
D. Create a global table and specify the AWS Regions where the table will be available. 
E. Enable automatic backups on the source instance by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0.

to complete before creating a read replica. If you create multiple read replicas in parallel from the same source DB instance, Amazon RDS takes only one snapshot at the start of the first create action. 
When creating a read replica, there are a few things to consider. First, you must enable automatic backups on the source DB instance by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0. This requirement also applies to a read replica that is the source DB instance for another read replica
