A company is developing a new mobile app. The company must implement proper trafic filtering to protect its Application Load Balancer (ALB) against common application-level attacks, such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. The company has minimal infrastructure and operational staff. The company needs to reduce its share of the responsibility in managing, updating, and securing servers for its AWS environment. What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 

A. Configure AWS WAF rules and associate them with the ALB. 

B. Deploy the application using Amazon S3 with public hosting enabled. 

C. Deploy AWS Shield Advanced and add the ALB as a protected resource. 

D. Create a new ALB that directs trafic to an Amazon EC2 instance running a third-party firewall, which then passes the trafic to the current ALB.

By configuring AWS WAF rules and associating them with the ALB, the company can filter and block malicious traffic before it reaches the application. AWS WAF offers pre-configured rule sets and allows custom rule creation to protect against common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection. 
Option B does not provide the necessary security and traffic filtering capabilities to protect against application-level attacks. It is more suitable for hosting static content rather than implementing security measures. 
Option C is focused on DDoS protection rather than application-level attacks like XSS or SQL injection. While AWS Shield Advanced does not address the specific requirements mentioned in the scenario.
Option D involves maintaining and securing additional infrastructure, which goes against the requirement of reducing responsibility and relying on minimal operational staff.
