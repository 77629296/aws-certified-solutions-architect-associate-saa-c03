A. Reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target. 
B. Change the ALB balancing algorithm to least outstanding requests. 
C. Reduce the size of the EC2 instances in both environments. 
D. Reduce the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environmentâ€™s Auto Scaling group
