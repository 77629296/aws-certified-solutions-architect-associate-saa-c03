A company runs a Â­fleet of web servers using an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. After a routine compliance check, the company sets a standard that requires a recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 1 second for all its production databases. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Enable a Multi-AZ deployment for the DB instance. 
B. Enable auto scaling for the DB instance in one Availability Zone. 
C. Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and create multiple read replicas in a separate Availability Zone. 
D. Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) change data capture (CDC) tasks

By using Multi-AZ deployment, the company can achieve an RPO of less than 1 second because the standby instance is always in sync with the primary instance, ensuring that data changes are continuously replicated.
