A company hosts its static website by using Amazon S3. The company wants to add a contact form to its webpage. The contact form will have dynamic server-side components for users to input their name, email address, phone number, and user message. The company anticipates that there will be fewer than 100 site visits each month. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Host a dynamic contact form page in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Set up Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to connect to any third-party email provider. 
B. Create an Amazon API Gateway endpoint with an AWS Lambda backend that makes a call to Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES). 
C. Convert the static webpage to dynamic by deploying Amazon Lightsail. Use client-side scripting to build the contact form. Integrate the form with Amazon WorkMail. 
D. Create a t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance. Deploy a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack to host the webpage. Use client-side scripting to build the contact form. Integrate the form with Amazon WorkMail.
