A company needs to export its database once a day to Amazon S3 for other teams to access. The exported object size varies between 2 GB and 5 GB. The S3 access pattern for the data is variable and changes rapidly. The data must be immediately available and must remain accessible for up to 3 months. The company needs the most cost-effective solution that will not increase retrieval time. Which S3 storage class should the company use to meet these requirements? 

A. S3 Intelligent-Tiering 
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 
C. S3 Standard 
D. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the Infrequent Access tier and after 90 days of no access to the Archive Instant Access tier
