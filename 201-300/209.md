A solutions architect is designing the architecture of a new application being deployed to the AWS Cloud. The application will run on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances and will automatically scale across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances will scale up and down frequently throughout the day. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will handle the load distribution. The architecture needs to support distributed session data management. The company is willing to make changes to code if needed. What should the solutions architect do to ensure that the architecture supports distributed session data management? 

A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data. 
B. Use session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB to manage session data. 
C. Use Session Manager from AWS Systems Manager to manage the session. 
D. Use the GetSessionToken API operation in AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to manage the session.


The correct answer is A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data. 
In order to support distributed session data management in this scenario, it is necessary to use a distributed data store such as Amazon ElastiCache. This will allow the session data to be stored and accessed by multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones, which is necessary for a scalable and highly available architecture. 
Option B, using session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB, would not be sufficient because this would only allow the session data to be stored on a single EC2 instance, which would not be able to scale across multiple Availability Zones. 
Options C and D, using Session Manager and the GetSessionToken API operation in AWS STS, are not related to session data management and would not be appropriate solutions for this scenario.
