A company hosts multiple production applications. One of the applications consists of resources from Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, Amazon RDS, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) across multiple AWS Regions. All company resources are tagged with a tag name of “application” and a value that corresponds to each application. A solutions architect must provide the quickest solution for identifying all of the tagged components. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Use AWS CloudTrail to generate a list of resources with the application tag. 
B. Use the AWS CLI to query each service across all Regions to report the tagged components. 
C. Run a query in Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights to report on the components with the application tag. 
D. Run a query with the AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor to report on the resources globally with the application tag
