A company has a web server running on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet with an Elastic IP address. The default security group is assigned to the EC2 instance. The default network ACL has been modified to block all trafic. A solutions architect needs to make the web server accessible from everywhere on port 443. Which combination of steps will accomplish this task? (Choose two.) 

A. Create a security group with a rule to allow TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0.

B. Create a security group with a rule to allow TCP port 443 to destination 0.0.0.0/0. 

C. Update the network ACL to allow TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0. 

D. Update the network ACL to allow inbound/outbound TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and to destination 0.0.0.0/0. 

E. Update the network ACL to allow inbound TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and outbound TCP port 32768-65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0.

A, E is perfect the combination. To be more precise, We should add outbound with "outbound TCP port 32768-65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0." as an ephemeral port due to the stateless of NACL.
