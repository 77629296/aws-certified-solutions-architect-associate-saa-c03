A company has one million users that use its mobile app. The company must analyze the data usage in near-real time. The company also must encrypt the data in near-real time and must store the data in a centralized location in Apache Parquet format for further processing. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Create an Amazon Kinesis data stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to send the data to the Kinesis Data Analytics application. 
B. Create an Amazon Kinesis data stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to analyze the data. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to send the data to the EMR cluster. 
C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to analyze the data. 
D. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data.

This solution will meet the requirements with the least operational overhead as it uses Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service that can automatically handle the data collection, data transformation, encryption, and data storage in near-real time. 
Kinesis Data Firehose can automatically store the data in Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format for further processing. Additionally, it allows you to create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data in near real-time, with no need to manage any infrastructure or invoke any Lambda function. This way you can process a large amount of data with the least operational overhead
