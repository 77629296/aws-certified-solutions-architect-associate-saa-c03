A solutions architect is designing a new API using Amazon API Gateway that will receive requests from users. The volume of requests is highly variable; several hours can pass without receiving a single request. The data processing will take place asynchronously, but should be completed within a few seconds after a request is made. Which compute service should the solutions architect have the API invoke to deliver the requirements at the lowest cost? 

A. An AWS Glue job 

B. An AWS Lambda function 

C. A containerized service hosted in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) 

D. A containerized service hosted in Amazon ECS with Amazon EC2

Lambda is a serverless compute service that can be triggered by API Gateway to process requests asynchronously. It automatically scales based on the incoming request volume and allows for cost optimization by charging only for the actual compute time used to process the requests.
