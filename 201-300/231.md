An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance that has an Elastic IP address in VPC 
A. The application requires access to a database in VPC 
B. Both VPCs are in the same AWS account. Which solution will provide the required access MOST securely? 

A. Create a DB instance security group that allows all trafic from the public IP address of the application server in VPC A. 

B. Configure a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B. 

C. Make the DB instance publicly accessible. Assign a public IP address to the DB instance. 

D. Launch an EC2 instance with an Elastic IP address into VPC B. Proxy all requests through the new EC2 instance

The most secure solution is to configure a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs. This allows private communication between the application server and the database, without exposing resources to the public internet.
