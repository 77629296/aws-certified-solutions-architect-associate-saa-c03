A company runs a web application that is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnet of a VPC. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) that extends across the public subnets directs web trafic to the EC2 instances. The company wants to implement new security measures to restrict inbound trafic from the ALB to the EC2 instances while preventing access from any other source inside or outside the private subnet of the EC2 instances. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure a route in a route table to direct trafic from the internet to the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances. 
B. Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to only allow trafic that comes from the security group for the ALB. 
C. Move the EC2 instances into the public subnet. Give the EC2 instances a set of Elastic IP addresses. 
D. Configure the security group for the ALB to allow any TCP trafic on any port
