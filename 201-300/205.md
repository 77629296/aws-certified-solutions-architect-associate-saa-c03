A company hosts a marketing website in an on-premises data center. The website consists of static documents and runs on a single server. An administrator updates the website content infrequently and uses an SFTP client to upload new documents. The company decides to host its website on AWS and to use Amazon CloudFront. The companyâ€™s solutions architect creates a CloudFront distribution. The solutions architect must design the most cost-effective and resilient architecture for website hosting to serve as the CloudFront origin. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create a virtual server by using Amazon Lightsail. Cofigure the web server in the Lightsail instance. Upload website content by using an SFTP client. 

B. Create an AWS Auto Scaling group for Amazon EC2 instances. Use an Application Load Balancer. Upload website content by using an SFTP client. 

C. Create a private Amazon S3 bucket. Use an S3 bucket policy to allow access from a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI). Upload website content by using the AWS CLI.

D. Create a public Amazon S3 bucket. Cofigure AWS Transfer for SFTP. Cofigure the S3 bucket for website hosting. Upload website content by using the SFTP client.
