A company collects data from thousands of remote devices by using a RESTful web services application that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The EC2 instance receives the raw data, transforms the raw data, and stores all the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The number of remote devices will increase into the millions soon. The company needs a highly scalable solution that minimizes operational overhead. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Use AWS Glue to process the raw data in Amazon S3. 
B. Use Amazon Route 53 to route trafic to different EC2 instances. 
C. Add more EC2 instances to accommodate the increasing amount of incoming data. 
D. Send the raw data to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Use EC2 instances to process the data. 
E. Use Amazon API Gateway to send the raw data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. ConÂ¬ gure Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to use the data stream as a source to deliver the data to Amazon S3
