A company needs to migrate a legacy application from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud because of hardware capacity constraints. The application runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The applicationâ€™s database storage continues to grow over time. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon S3. 
B. Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon RDS On-Demand Instances. 
C. Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon Aurora Reserved Instances. 
D. Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon RDS Reserved Instances.

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances allow for significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instances for long-running, steady-state workloads like this one. Reserved Instances provide a capacity reservation, so the instances are guaranteed to be available for the duration of the reservation period. 
Amazon Aurora is a highly scalable, cloud-native relational database service that is designed to be compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. It can automatically scale up to meet growing storage requirements, so it can accommodate the application's database storage needs over time. By using Reserved Instances for Aurora, the cost savings will be significant over the long term.
