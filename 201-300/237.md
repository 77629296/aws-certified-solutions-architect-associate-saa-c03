An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to access files in another EC2 instance in VPC-B. Both VPCs are in separate AWS accounts. The network administrator needs to design a solution to configure secure access to EC2 instance in VPC-B from VPC- A. The connectivity should not have a single point of failure or bandwidth concerns. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Set up a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B. 
B. Set up VPC gateway endpoints for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B. 
C. Attach a virtual private gateway to VPC-B and set up routing from VPC-A. 
D. Create a private virtual interface (VIF) for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B and add appropriate routes from VPC-A.
