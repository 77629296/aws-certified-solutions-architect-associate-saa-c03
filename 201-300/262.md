A company plans to use Amazon ElastiCache for its multi-tier web application. A solutions architect creates a Cache VPC for the ElastiCache cluster and an App VPC for the application’s Amazon EC2 instances. Both VPCs are in the us-east-1 Region. The solutions architect must implement a solution to provide the application’s EC2 instances with access to the ElastiCache cluster. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Create a peering connection between the VPCs. Add a route table entry for the peering connection in both VPCs. Configure an inbound rule for the ElastiCache cluster’s security group to allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
B. Create a Transit VPC. Update the VPC route tables in the Cache VPC and the App VPC to route tra® c through the Transit VPC. Configure an inbound rule for the ElastiCache cluster's security group to allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
C. Create a peering connection between the VPCs. Add a route table entry for the peering connection in both VPCs. Configure an inbound rule for the peering connection’s security group to allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
D. Create a Transit VPC. Update the VPC route tables in the Cache VPC and the App VPC to route tra® c through the Transit VPC. Configure an inbound rule for the Transit VPC’s security group to allow inbound connection from the application’s security group
