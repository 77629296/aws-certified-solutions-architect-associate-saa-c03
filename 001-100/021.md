An ecommerce company wants to launch a one-deal-a-day website on AWS. Each day will feature exactly one product on sale for a period of 24 hours. The company wants to be able to handle millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency during peak hours. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use Amazon S3 to host the full website in different S3 buckets. Add Amazon CloudFront distributions. Set the S3 buckets as origins for the distributions. Store the order data in Amazon S3. 

B. Deploy the full website on Amazon EC2 instances that run in Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones. Add an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute the website trafic. Add another ALB for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. 

C. Migrate the full application to run in containers. Host the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to increase and decrease the number of pods to process bursts in trafic. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. 

D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Explain:
Answer A "host the full website in different S3 buckets", remove A. 
Answer B "Deploy full website on EC2", remove B. 
Answer C, use Kubernetes is quite overhead, Amazon DynamoDB faster than Amazon RDS for MySQL. 
Answer D is suitalbe in technical architect design, with Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB. for "LEAD operational overhead" (not mean migration/re-architect overhead, it is operational). Choose D.
