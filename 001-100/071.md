A company runs a shopping application that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store customer information. In case of data corruption, a solutions architect needs to design a solution that meets a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour. What should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 

A. Configure DynamoDB global tables. For RPO recovery, point the application to a different AWS Region. 

B. Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time. 

C. Export the DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis. For RPO recovery, import the data from S3 Glacier to DynamoDB. 

D. Schedule Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 15 minutes. For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot
