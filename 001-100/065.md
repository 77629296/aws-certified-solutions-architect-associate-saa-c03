A hospital recently deployed a RESTful API with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The hospital uses API Gateway and Lambda to upload reports that are in PDF format and JPEG format. The hospital needs to modify the Lambda code to identify protected health information (PHI)
in the reports. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use existing Python libraries to extract the text from the reports and to identify the PHI from the extracted text. 

B. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon SageMaker to identify the PHI from the extracted text. 

C. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text. 

D. Use Amazon Rekognition to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
