A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis. The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days. What is the MOST operationally eficient solution that meets these requirements? 

A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. 

B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. 

C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days. 

D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue

Explain:
B suggests launching EC2 instances to ingest and store the alerts, which introduces additional infrastructure management overhead and may not be as cost-effective and scalable as using managed services like Kinesis Data Firehose and S3. 
C involves delivering the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and manually managing snapshots and data deletion. This introduces additional complexity and manual overhead compared to the simpler solution of using Kinesis Data Firehose and S3. 
D suggests using SQS to ingest the alerts, but it does not provide the same level of data persistence and durability as storing the alerts directly in S3. Additionally, it requires manual processing and copying of messages to S3, which adds operational complexity. 
Therefore, A provides the most operationally efficient solution that meets the company's requirements by leveraging Kinesis Data Firehose to ingest the alerts, storing them in an S3 bucket, and using an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to S3 Glacier for long-term archival, all without the need for managing additional infrastructure.
