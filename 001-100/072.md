A company runs a photo processing application that needs to frequently upload and download pictures from Amazon S3 buckets that are located in the same AWS Region. A solutions architect has noticed an increased cost in data transfer fees and needs to implement a solution to reduce these costs. How can the solutions architect meet this requirement? 

A. Deploy Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjust the route table to route S3 calls through it. 

B. Deploy a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets. 

C. Deploy the application into a public subnet and allow it to route through an internet gateway to access the S3 buckets. 

D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.
