A company wants to run its critical applications in containers to meet requirements for scalability and availability. The company prefers to focus on maintenance of the critical applications. The company does not want to be responsible for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure that runs the containerized workload. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Use Amazon EC2 instances, and install Docker on the instances. 

B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on Amazon EC2 worker nodes. 

C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate. 

D. Use Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

Explain:
AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without having to manage servers. AWS Fargate is compatible with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
