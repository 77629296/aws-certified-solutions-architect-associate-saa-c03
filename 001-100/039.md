A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against this data every day through the company's website. The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem. Which solution addresses this performance issue? 

A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD. 

B. Change the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class. 

C. Change the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class. 

D. Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication.

Explain:
A: Made for high levels of I/O opps for consistent, predictable performance. 
B: Can improve performance of insert opps, but it's a storage performance rather than processing power problem 
C: for moderate CPU usage 
D: for scale read-only replicas and doesn't improve performance of insert opps on the primary DB instance
