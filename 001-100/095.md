An application allows users at a company's headquarters to access product data. The product data is stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The operations team has isolated an application performance slowdown and wants to separate read trafic from write trafic. A solutions architect needs to optimize the application's performance quickly. What should the solutions architect recommend?

B. Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the secondary Availability Zone. 

C. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with half of the compute and storage resources as the source database. 

D. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.
