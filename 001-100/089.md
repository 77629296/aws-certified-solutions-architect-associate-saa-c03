A company uses Amazon S3 to store its confudential audit documents. The S3 bucket uses bucket policies to restrict access to audit team IAM user credentials according to the principle of least privilege. Company managers are worried about accidental deletion of documents in the S3 bucket and want a more secure solution. What should a solutions architect do to secure the audit documents? 

A. Enable the versioning and MFA Delete features on the S3 bucket. 

B. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the IAM user credentials for each audit team IAM user account. 

C. Add an S3 Lifecycle policy to the audit team's IAM user accounts to deny the s3:DeleteObject action during audit dates. 

D. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the S3 bucket and restrict audit team IAM user accounts from accessing the KMS key.
