A company has registered its domain name with Amazon Route 53. The company uses Amazon API Gateway in the ca-central-1 Region as a public interface for its backend microservice APIs. Third-party services consume the APIs securely. The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate so that the third-party services can use HTTPS. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL.
Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint.
Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. 

C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route trafic to the API Gateway endpoint. 

D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name

Explain:
To design the API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate, the company needs to do the following: 
1. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to create an endpoint that is specific to a region. 
2. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name: This will allow the company to use its own domain name for the API Gateway URL. 
3. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region: This will allow the company to use HTTPS for secure communication with its APIs.
4. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use the certificate for securing the API Gateway URL. 
5. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway URL using the company's domain name.
