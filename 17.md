A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket. What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement? 

A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances. 

B. Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances. 

C. Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances. 

D. Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.

Explain: 
A: Correct - IAM role is used to grant access for AWS services like EC2, Lambda,... 
B: Incorrect - IAM policy only apply for users cannot attach it to EC2 (AWS service). 
C: Incorrect - IAM group is used to group of permission and attach to list of users. 
D: Incorrect - To make EC2 work we need access key and secret access key but not user account. But even when we use access key and secret access key of user it's not recommended because anyone can access EC2 instance can get your access key and secret access key and get all permission from the owner. The secure way is using IAM role which we just specify enough role for EC2 instance.
