A company uses an on-premises network-attached storage (NAS) system to provide file shares to its high performance computing (HPC) workloads. The company wants to migrate its latency-sensitive HPC workloads and its storage to the AWS Cloud. The company must be able to provide NFS and SMB multi-protocol access from the file system. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST latency? (Choose two.) 

A. Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a cluster placement group. 
B. Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a partition placement group. 
C. Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. 
D. Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. 
E. Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides access to shared file storage over all versions of the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols, and also supports multi-protocol access (i.e. concurrent NFS and SMB access) to the same data. As a result, you can access Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP from virtually any Linux, Windows, or macOS client.
