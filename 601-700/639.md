A company is building a new furniture inventory application. The company has deployed the application on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in their VPC. A solutions architect has observed that incoming trafic seems to favor one EC2 instance, resulting in latency for some requests. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue? 

A. Disable session afinity (sticky sessions) on the ALB 
B. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer 
C. Increase the number of EC2 instances in each Availability Zone 
D. Adjust the frequency of the health checks on the ALB's target group
