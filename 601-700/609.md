A. Create an IAM role that includes permissions to access Lake Formation tables. 
B. Create data filters to implement row-level security and cell-level security. 
C. Create an AWS Lambda function that removes sensitive information before Lake Formation ingests the data. 
D. Create an AWS Lambda function that periodically queries and removes sensitive information from Lake Formation tables.
