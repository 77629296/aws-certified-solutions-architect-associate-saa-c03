A company has a web application that runs on premises. The application experiences latency issues during peak hours. The latency issues occur twice each month. At the start of a latency issue, the application's CPU utilization immediately increases to 10 times its normal amount. The company wants to migrate the application to AWS to improve latency. The company also wants to scale the application automatically when application demand increases. The company will use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale based on requests. 
B. Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale based on requests. 
C. Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale on a schedule. 
D. Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale on predictive metrics.

Burstable Performance Instances (T3 or T3a): These instances are designed for burstable workloads and provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above that baseline when needed. Bursting is particularly beneficial for handling sudden spikes in CPU utilization, such as those described in the scenario
Unlimited Mode: Enabling "unlimited" mode allows instances to burst beyond their baseline performance without accumulating CPU credits. This is important for handling sudden and sustained increases in CPU utilization during peak hours
Scale on Predictive Metrics: Configuring the environment to scale on predictive metrics allows AWS Elastic Beanstalk to proactively adjust the number of instances based on anticipated demand. This can help ensure that the environment is scaled up before the latency issues occur, addressing them in advance
