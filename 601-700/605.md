A company has several on-premises Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (ISCSI) network storage servers. The company wants to reduce the number of these servers by moving to the AWS Cloud. A solutions architect must provide low-latency access to frequently used data and reduce the dependency on on-premises servers with a minimal number of infrastructure changes. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Deploy an Amazon S3 File Gateway. 
B. Deploy Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage with backups to Amazon S3. 
C. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway that is configured with stored volumes. 
D. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway that is configured with cached volumes.

The Storage Gateway volume gateway provides iSCSI block storage using cached volumes. This allows replacing the on-premises iSCSI servers with minimal changes. Cached volumes store frequently accessed data locally for low latency access, while storing less frequently accessed data in S3. This reduces the number of on-premises servers while still providing low latency access to hot data. 
EBS does not provide iSCSI support to replace the existing servers. 
S3 File Gateway is for file storage, not block storage. 
Stored volumes would store all data on-premises, not in S3
