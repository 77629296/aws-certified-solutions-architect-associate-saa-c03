A company runs a production database on Amazon RDS for MySQL. The company wants to upgrade the database version for security compliance reasons. Because the database contains critical data, the company wants a quick solution to upgrade and test functionality without losing any data. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Create an RDS manual snapshot. Upgrade to the new version of Amazon RDS for MySQL. 
B. Use native backup and restore. Restore the data to the upgraded new version of Amazon RDS for MySQL. 
C. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the data to the upgraded new version of Amazon RDS for MySQL. 
D. Use Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments to deploy and test production changes.

A blue/green deployment copies a production database environment to a separate, synchronized staging environment. You can make changes to the database in the staging environment without affecting the production environment. When you are ready, you can promote the staging environment to be the new production database environment, with downtime typically under one minute.
