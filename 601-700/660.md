A. Configure an Application Load Balancer to distribute trafic properly to the instances.
B. Configure a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on memory utilization. 
C. Configure a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization.
