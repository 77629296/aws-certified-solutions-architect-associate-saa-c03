A solutions architect is designing a new service behind Amazon API Gateway. The request patterns for the service will be unpredictable and can change suddenly from 0 requests to over 500 per second. The total size of the data that needs to be persisted in a backend database is currently less than 1 GB with unpredictable future growth. Data can be queried using simple key-value requests. Which combination ofAWS services would meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. AWS Fargate 
B. AWS Lambda 
C. Amazon DynamoDB 
D. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling 
E. MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora\

Scalable, unpredictable request patterns = AWS Lambda 
Scalable, key-value data = Amazon DynamoDB
