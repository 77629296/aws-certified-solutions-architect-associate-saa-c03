A company wants to migrate two DNS servers to AWS. The servers host a total of approximately 200 zones and receive 1 million requests each day on average. The company wants to maximize availability while minimizing the operational overhead that is related to the management of the two servers. What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 

A. Create 200 new hosted zones in the Amazon Route 53 console Import zone files. 
B. Launch a single large Amazon EC2 instance Import zone tiles. Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms and notifications to alert the company about any downtime. 
C. Migrate the servers to AWS by using AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms and notifications to alert the company about any downtime. 
D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones. Import zone files. Set the desired capacity to 1 and the maximum capacity to 3 for the Auto Scaling group. Configure scaling alarms to scale based on CPU utilization.

R53 is designed exactly to do this and supports zone import functionality so literally does the job of their EC2 servers but much better so BCD become "overhead" by default. I doubt D will work.
