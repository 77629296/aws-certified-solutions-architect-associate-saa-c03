An ecommerce company runs a PostgreSQL database on premises. The database stores data by using high IOPS Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) block storage. The daily peak I/O transactions per second do not exceed 15,000 IOPS. The company wants to migrate the database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and provision disk IOPS performance independent of disk storage capacity. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS. 
B. Configure the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS. 
C. Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS. 
D. Configure the EBS magnetic volume type to achieve maximum IOPS.

Both gp2 and gp3 can provision up to 16.000 IOPS. gp3 is cheaper than gp2.
