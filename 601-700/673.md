A company runs an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that the company frequently accesses for up to 7 days after the file creation date. After 7 days, the company needs to be able to access the files with a maximum retrieval time of 24 hours. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS. 
B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to increase the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days. 
C. Create an Amazon FSx File Gateway to increase the company's storage space. Create an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data after 7 days. 
D. Configure access to Amazon S3 for each user. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days
