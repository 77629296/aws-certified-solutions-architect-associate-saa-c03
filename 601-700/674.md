A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses a database that runs on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The application performs slowly when trafuc increases. The database experiences a heavy read load during periods of high traffic. Which actions should a solutions architect take to resolve these performance issues? (Choose two.) 

A. Turn on auto scaling for the DB instance. 
B. Create a read replica for the DB instance. Configure the application to send read trafuc to the read replica. 
C. Convert the DB instance to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Configure the application to send read trafuc to the standby DB instance. 
D. Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Configure the application to cache query results in the ElastiCache cluster. 
E. Configure the Auto Scaling group subnets to ensure that the EC2 instances are provisioned in the same Availability Zone as the DB instance.
