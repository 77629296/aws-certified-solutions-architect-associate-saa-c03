A company has a web application that includes an embedded NoSQL database. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone. A recent increase in trafic requires the application to be highly available and for the database to be eventually consistent. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer. Maintain the embedded NoSQL database with its replication service on the EC2 instances. 
B. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer. Migrate the embedded NoSQL database to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). 
C. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use EC2 instances across three Availability Zones. Maintain the embedded NoSQL database with its replication service on the EC2 instances. 
D. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use EC2 instances across three Availability Zones. Migrate the embedded NoSQL database to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS).
