A company is building a microservices-based application that will be deployed on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The microservices will interact with each other. The company wants to ensure that the application is observable to identify performance issues in the future. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure the application to use Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the number of requests that are sent to the microservices. 
B. Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to collect metrics from the EKS clusters. Configure AWS X-Ray to trace the requests between the microservices. 
C. Configure AWS CloudTrail to review the API calls. Build an Amazon QuickSight dashboard to observe the microservice interactions. 
D. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to understand the performance of the application

Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights: This service provides monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities for containerized applications. It collects and aggregates metrics, logs, and events from Amazon EKS clusters and containers. This helps in monitoring the performance and health of microservices.
