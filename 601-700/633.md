A company manages an application that stores data on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB instance. Increases in trafic are causing performance problems. The company determines that database queries are the primary reason for the slow performance. What should a solutions architect do to improve the application's performance? 

A. Serve read trafic from the Multi-AZ standby replica. 
B. Configure the DB instance to use Transfer Acceleration. 
C. Create a read replica from the source DB instance. Serve read trafic from the read replica. 
D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose between the application and Amazon RDS to increase the concurrency of database requests.

A Multi-AZ DB instance Creates a primary DB instance with one standby DB instance in a different Availability Zone. Using a Multi-AZ DB instance provides high availability, but the standby DB instance doesn't support connections for read workloads.
