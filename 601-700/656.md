A company runs a website that stores images of historical events. Website users need the ability to search and view images based on the year that the event in the image occurred. On average, users request each image only once or twice a year. The company wants a highly available solution to store and deliver the images to users. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Store images in Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Use a web server that runs on Amazon EC2. 
B. Store images in Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Use a web server that runs on Amazon EC2. 
C. Store images in Amazon S3 Standard. Use S3 Standard to directly deliver images by using a static website. 
D. Store images in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). Use S3 Standard-IA to directly deliver images by using a static website.
