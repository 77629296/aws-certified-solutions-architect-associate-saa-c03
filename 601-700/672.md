A marketing company receives a large amount of new clickstream data in Amazon S3 from a marketing campaign. The company needs to analyze the clickstream data in Amazon S3 quickly. Then the company needs to determine whether to process the data further in the data pipeline. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Create external tables in a Spark catalog. Configure jobs in AWS Glue to query the data. 
B. Configure an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data. Configure Amazon Athena to query the data. 
C. Create external tables in a Hive metastore. Configure Spark jobs in Amazon EMR to query the data. 
D. Configure an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data. Configure Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to use SQL to query the data

AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service, and Athena is a serverless query service that allows you to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using SQL queries. By configuring an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data, you can create a schema for the data, and then use Athena to query the data directly without the need to load it into a separate database. This minimizes operational overhead.
