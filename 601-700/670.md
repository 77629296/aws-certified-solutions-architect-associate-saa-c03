A company performs tests on an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table. The tests run for 4 hours once a week. The company knows how many read and write operations the application performs to the table each second during the tests. The company does not currently use DynamoDB for any other use case. A solutions architect needs to optimize the costs for the table. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Choose on-demand mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately. 
B. Choose provisioned mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately. 
C. Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 1-year term. 
D. Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 3-year term

Provisoned Mode shoud be the answer seeing that the workloads are predictable and DynamoDB isnt used for any other thing

Agree with B, on-demand mode might not scale fast enough after the DB has been idle for 164 hours. As they know exactly the number of reads and writes per second, should use provisioned mode, and set capacity to 1 RCU and 1 WCU while the DB is not in use.
