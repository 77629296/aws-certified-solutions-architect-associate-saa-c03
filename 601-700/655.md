A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that has a target group. The company designed the application to work with session affinity (sticky sessions) for a better user experience. The application must be available publicly over the internet as an endpoint. A WAF must be applied to the endpoint for additional security. Session afinity (sticky sessions) must be configured on the endpoint. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Create a public Network Load Balancer. Specify the application target group. 
B. Create a Gateway Load Balancer. Specify the application target group. 
C. Create a public Application Load Balancer. Specify the application target group. 
D. Create a second target group. Add Elastic IP addresses to the EC2 instances. 
E. Create a web ACL in AWS WAF. Associate the web ACL with the endpoint

NLB and GLB cannot handle sticky sessions. It's an application level concept (Cookies) so ALB works.
