A company needs to provide customers with secure access to its data. The company processes customer data and stores the results in an Amazon S3 bucket. All the data is subject to strong regulations and security requirements. The data must be encrypted at rest. Each customer must be able to access only their data from their AWS account. Company employees must not be able to access the data. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Provision an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for each customer. Encrypt the data client-side. In the private certificate policy, deny access to the certificate for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides. 
B. Provision a separate AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for each customer. Encrypt the data server-side. In the S3 bucket policy, deny decryption of data for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides. 
C. Provision a separate AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for each customer. Encrypt the data server-side. In each KMS key policy, deny decryption of data for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides. 
D. Provision an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for each customer. Encrypt the data client-side. In the public certificate policy, deny access to the certificate for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.
