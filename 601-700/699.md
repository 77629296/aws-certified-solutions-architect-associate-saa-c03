A company has an application that uses Docker containers in its local data center. The application runs on a container host that stores persistent data in a volume on the host. The container instances use the stored persistent data. The company wants to move the application to a fully managed service because the company does not want to manage any servers or storage infrastructure. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with self-managed nodes. Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume attached to an Amazon EC2 instance. Use the EBS volume as a persistent volume mounted in the containers. 
B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an AWS Fargate launch type. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Add the EFS volume as a persistent storage volume mounted in the containers. 
C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an AWS Fargate launch type. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Map the S3 bucket as a persistent storage volume mounted in the containers. 
D. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an Amazon EC2 launch type. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Add the EFS volume as a persistent storage volume mounted in the containers.

Mounting S3 in Fargate is not supported commonly. You'd have to make it manually. EFS is very well supported with Fargate.
