A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet. The application needs to process sensitive information from an Amazon S3 bucket. The application must not use the internet to connect to the S3 bucket. Which solution will meet these requirements? 
A. Configure an internet gateway. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the internet gateway. Update the application to use the new internet gateway. 
B. Configure a VPN connection. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the VPN connection. Update the application to use the new VPN connection. 
C. Configure a NAT gateway. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the NAT gateway. Update the application to use the new NAT gateway. 
D. Configure a VPC endpoint. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the VPC endpoint. Update the application to use the new VPC endpoint.

VPC endpoints allow private connectivity from VPCs to AWS services like S3 without using an internet gateway. 
The application can connect to S3 through the VPC endpoint while remaining in the private subnet, without internet access.
