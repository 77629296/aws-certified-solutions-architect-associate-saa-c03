A company is moving its data and applications to AWS during a multiyear migration project. The company wants to securely access data on Amazon S3 from the company's AWS Region and from the company's on-premises location. The data must not traverse the internet. The company has established an AWS Direct Connect connection between its Region and its on-premises location. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create gateway endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the gateway endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location. 
B. Create a gateway in AWS Transit Gateway to access Amazon S3 securely from the Region and the on-premises location. 
C. Create interface endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the interface endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on- premises location. 
D. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to access the data securely from the Region and the on-premises location

With AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3, you can provision interface VPC endpoints (interface endpoints) in your virtual private cloud (VPC). These endpoints are directly accessible from applications that are on premises over VPN and AWS Direct Connect, or in a different AWS Region over VPC peering
