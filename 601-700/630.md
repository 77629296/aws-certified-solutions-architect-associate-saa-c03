A solutions architect is creating a data processing job that runs once daily and can take up to 2 hours to complete. If the job is interrupted, it has to restart from the beginning. How should the solutions architect address this issue in the MOST cost-effective manner? 

A. Create a script that runs locally on an Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance that is triggered by a cron job. 
B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event. 
C. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Fargate task triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event. 
D. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task running on Amazon EC2 triggered by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.

 EC2 is more expensive than Fargate for 2 hours duration as EC2 instance will be billed.
