A company's application uses Network Load Balancers, Auto Scaling groups, Amazon EC2 instances, and databases that are deployed in an Amazon VPC. The company wants to capture information about trafic to and from the network interfaces in near real time in its Amazon VPC. The company wants to send the information to Amazon OpenSearch Service for analysis. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the log group. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the logs from the log group to OpenSearch Service. 
B. Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the log group. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream the logs from the log group to OpenSearch Service. 
C. Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the trail. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the logs from the trail to OpenSearch Service. 
D. Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the trail. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream the logs from the trail to OpenSearch Service

CloudTrail is for logging administrative actions, we need CloudWatch. 
We want the data in another AWS service (OpenSearch), not Kinesis, thus we need Firehose, not Streams.
