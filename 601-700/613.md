A company uses Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to run a container application. The EKS cluster stores sensitive information in the Kubernetes secrets object. The company wants to ensure that the information is encrypted. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use the container application to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). 
B. Enable secrets encryption in the EKS cluster by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). 
C. Implement an AWS Lambda function to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). 
D. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

EKS supports encrypting Kubernetes secrets at the cluster level using AWS KMS keys. This provides an automated way to encrypt secrets. 
Enabling this feature requires minimal configuration changes to the EKS cluster and no code changes.
