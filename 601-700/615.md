A company runs a critical, customer-facing application on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The application has a microservices architecture. The company needs to implement a solution that collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from the application in a centralized location. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Run the Amazon CloudWatch agent in the existing EKS cluster. View the metrics and logs in the CloudWatch console. 
B. Run AWS App Mesh in the existing EKS cluster. View the metrics and logs in the App Mesh console. 
C. Configure AWS CloudTrail to capture data events. Query CloudTrail by using Amazon OpenSearch Service. 
D. Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights in the existing EKS cluster. View the metrics and logs in the CloudWatch console.

Use CloudWatch Container Insights to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2. Container Insights supports collecting metrics from clusters deployed on AWS Fargate for both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
