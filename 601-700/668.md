A company created a new organization in AWS Organizations. The organization has multiple accounts for the company's development teams. The development team members use AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to access the accounts. For each of the company's applications, the development teams must use a predefined application name to tag resources that are created. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that gives the development team the ability to create resources only if the application name tag has an approved value. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create an IAM group that has a conditional Allow policy that requires the application name tag to be specified for resources to be created. 
B. Create a cross-account role that has a Deny policy for any resource that has the application name tag. 
C. Create a resource group in AWS Resource Groups to validate that the tags are applied to all resources in all accounts. 
D. Create a tag policy in Organizations that has a list of allowed application names.
