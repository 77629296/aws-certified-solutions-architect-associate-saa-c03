A development team is creating an event-based application that uses AWS Lambda functions. Events will be generated when files are added to an Amazon S3 bucket. The development team currently has Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) configured as the event target from Amazon S3. What should a solutions architect do to process the events from Amazon S3 in a scalable way? 

A. Create an SNS subscription that processes the event in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) before the event runs in Lambda. 
B. Create an SNS subscription that processes the event in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) before the event runs in Lambda 
C. Create an SNS subscription that sends the event to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure the SOS queue to trigger a Lambda function. 
D. Create an SNS subscription that sends the event to AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS). Configure the Lambda function to poll from the SMS event

SNS is notified on file creation in S3. SNS publishes to SQS which can scale according to the input load automatically. Lambda execution can scale a lot when attached to SQS.
