A company has migrated a two-tier application from its on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. The data tier is a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for Oracle with 12 TB of General Purpose SSD Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage. The application is designed to process and store documents in the database as binary large objects (blobs) with an average document size of 6 MB. The database size has grown over time, reducing the performance and increasing the cost of storage. The company must improve the database performance and needs a solution that is highly available and resilient. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Reduce the RDS DB instance size. Increase the storage capacity to 24 TiB. Change the storage type to Magnetic. 
B. Increase the RDS DB instance size. Increase the storage capacity to 24 TiChange the storage type to Provisioned IOPS. 
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Update the application to store documents in the S3 bucket. Store the object metadata in the existing database. 
D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the application to use DynamoDB. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate data from the Oracle database to DynamoDB
