A company wants to migrate its web applications from on premises to AWS. The company is located close to the eu-central-1 Region. Because of regulations, the company cannot launch some of its applications in eu-central-1. The company wants to achieve single-digit millisecond latency. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to an edge location in Amazon CloudFront. 
B. Deploy the applications in AWS Local Zones by extending the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Local Zone. 
C. Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to the regional edge caches in Amazon CloudFront. 
D. Deploy the applications in AWS Wavelength Zones by extending the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Wavelength Zone.

Option B - AWS Local Zones place AWS compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to end-users. This would allow the company to deploy applications within geographic proximity to eu-central-1 without being directly in the region, potentially meeting regulatory requirements and achieving low latency.

Whereas Option D - AWS Wavelength Zones are designed to provide developers the ability to build applications that deliver single-digit millisecond latencies to MOBILE and connected devices. And it's more focused on 5G Apps and may not be directly relevant to Web Apps hosting
