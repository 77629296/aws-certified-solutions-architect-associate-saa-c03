An online photo-sharing company stores its photos in an Amazon S3 bucket that exists in the us-west-1 Region. The company needs to store a copy of all new photos in the us-east-1 Region. Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational effort? 

A. Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy photos from the existing S3 bucket to the second S3 bucket. 
B. Create a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration of the existing S3 bucket. Specify us-east-1 in the CORS rule's AllowedOrigin element. 
C. Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1 across multiple Availability Zones. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to save photos into the second S3 bucket. 
D. Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1. Configure S3 event notifications on object creation and update events to invoke an AWS Lambda function to copy photos from the existing S3 bucket to the second S3 bucket.

S3 Cross-Region Replication handles automatically copying new objects added to the source bucket to the destination bucket in a different region. 
It continuously replicates new photos without needing to manually copy files or set up Lambda triggers. 
CORS only enables cross-origin access, it does not copy objects. 
Using Lifecycle rules or Lambda functions requires custom code and logic to handle the copying. 
S3 Cross-Region Replication provides automated replication that minimizes operational overhead
