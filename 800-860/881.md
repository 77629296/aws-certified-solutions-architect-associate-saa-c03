A company is hosting a high-traffic static website on Amazon S3 with an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has a default TTL of 0 seconds. The company wants to implement caching to improve performance for the website. However, the company also wants to ensure that stale content is not served for more than a few minutes after a deployment. Which combination of caching methods should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

A. Set the CloudFront default TTL to 2 minutes. 
B. Set a default TTL of 2 minutes on the S3 bucket. 
C. Add a Cache-Control private directive to the objects in Amazon S3. 
D. Create an AWS Lambda@Edge function to add an Expires header to HTTP responses. Configure the function to run on viewer response. 
E. Add a Cache-Control max-age directive of 24 hours to the objects in Amazon S3. On deployment, create a CloudFront invalidation to clear any changed files from edge caches.
