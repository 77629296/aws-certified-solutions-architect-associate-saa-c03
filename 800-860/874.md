A company hosts its application in the AWS Cloud. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer. The application connects to an Amazon DynamoDB table. For disaster recovery (DR) purposes, the company wants to ensure that the application is available from another AWS Region with minimal downtime. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST downtime? 

A. Create an Auto Scaling group and an ELB in the DR Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new DR Region's ELB. 
B. Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances, ELBs, and DynamoDB tables to be launched when necessary. Configure DNS failover to point to the new DR Region's ELB. 
C. Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances and an ELB to be launched when necessary. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new DR Region's ELB. 
D. Create an Auto Scaling group and an ELB in the DR Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm with an evaluation period of 10 minutes to invoke an AWS Lambda function that updates Amazon Route 53 to point to the DR Region's ELB.
