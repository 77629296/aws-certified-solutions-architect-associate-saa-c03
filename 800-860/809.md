A company uses an AWS Batch job to run its end-of-day sales process. The company needs a serverless solution that will invoke a third-party reporting application when the AWS Batch job is successful. The reporting application has an HTTP API interface that uses username and password authentication. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule to match incoming AWS Batch job SUCCEEDED events. Configure the third-party API as an EventBridge API destination with a username and password. Set the API destination as the EventBridge rule target. 
B. Configure Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to match incoming AWS Batch job SUCCEEDED events. Configure an AWS Lambda function to invoke the third-party API by using a username and password. Set the Lambda function as the EventBridge rule target. 
C. Configure an AWS Batch job to publish job SUCCEEDED events to an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure an HTTP proxy integration on the API Gateway REST API to invoke the third-party API by using a username and password. 
D. Configure an AWS Batch job to publish job SUCCEEDED events to an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure a proxy integration on the API Gateway REST API to an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to invoke the third-party API by using a username and password
