A company has an on-premises application that uses SFTP to collect financial data from multiple vendors. The company is migrating to the AWS Cloud. The company has created an application that uses Amazon S3 APIs to upload files from vendors. Some vendors run their systems on legacy applications that do not support S3 APIs. The vendors want to continue to use SFTP-based applications to upload data. The company wants to use managed services for the needs of the vendors that use legacy applications. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) instance to replicate data from the storage of the vendors that use legacy applications to Amazon S3. Provide the vendors with the credentials to access the AWS DMS instance. 
B. Create an AWS Transfer Family endpoint for vendors that use legacy applications. 
C. Configure an Amazon EC2 instance to run an SFTP server. Instruct the vendors that use legacy applications to use the SFTP server to upload data. 
D. Configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway for vendors that use legacy applications to upload files to an SMB file share
