An online gaming company hosts its platform on Amazon EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) across multiple AWS Regions. The NLBs can route requests to targets over the internet. The company wants to improve the customer playing experience by reducing end-to- end load time for its global customer base. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region to replace the existing NLBs. Register the existing EC2 instances as targets for the ALBs in each Region. 
B. Configure Amazon Route 53 to route equally weighted trafic to the NLBs in each Region. 
C. Create additional NLBs and EC2 instances in other Regions where the company has large customer bases. 
D. Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Configure the existing NLBs as target endpoints.
