A large international university has deployed all of its compute services in the AWS Cloud. These services include Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB. The university currently relies on many custom scripts to back up its infrastructure. However, the university wants to centralize management and automate data backups as much as possible by using AWS native options. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use third-party backup software with an AWS Storage Gateway tape gateway virtual tape library. 
B. Use AWS Backup to configure and monitor all backups for the services in use. 
C. Use AWS Config to set lifecycle management to take snapshots of all data sources on a schedule. 
D. Use AWS Systems Manager State Manager to manage the configuration and monitoring of backup tasks
