A company wants to restrict access to the content of its web application. The company needs to protect the content by using authorization techniques that are available on AWS. The company also wants to implement a serverless architecture for authorization and authentication that has low login latency. The solution must integrate with the web application and serve web content globally. The application currently has a small user base, but the company expects the application's user base to increase. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure Amazon Cognito for authentication. Implement Lambda@Edge for authorization. Configure Amazon CloudFront to serve the web application globally. 
B. Configure AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Implement AWS Lambda for authorization. Use an Application Load Balancer to serve the web application globally. 
C. Configure Amazon Cognito for authentication. Implement AWS Lambda for authorization. Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to serve the web application globally. 
D. Configure AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Implement Lambda@Edge for authorization. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to serve the web application globally
