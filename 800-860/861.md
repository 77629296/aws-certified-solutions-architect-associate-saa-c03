A company wants to relocate its on-premises MySQL database to AWS. The database accepts regular imports from a client-facing application, which causes a high volume of write operations. The company is concerned that the amount of traffic might be causing performance issues within the application. How should a solutions architect design the architecture on AWS? 

A. Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Provisioned IOPS SSD storage. Monitor write operation metrics by using Amazon CloudWatch. Adjust the provisioned IOPS if necessary. 
B. Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with General Purpose SSD storage. Place an Amazon ElastiCache cluster in front of the DB instance. Configure the application to query ElastiCache instead. 
C. Provision an Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) instance with a memory optimized instance type. Monitor Amazon CloudWatch for performance-related issues. Change the instance class if necessary. 
D. Provision an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system in General Purpose performance mode. Monitor Amazon CloudWatch for IOPS bottlenecks. Change to Provisioned Throughput performance mode if necessary.
