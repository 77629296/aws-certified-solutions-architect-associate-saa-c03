A solutions architect is designing a user authentication solution for a company. The solution must invoke two-factor authentication for users that log in from inconsistent geographical locations, IP addresses, or devices. The solution must also be able to scale up to accommodate millions of users. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Configure Amazon Cognito user pools for user authentication. Enable the risk-based adaptive authentication feature with multifactor authentication (MFA). 
B. Configure Amazon Cognito identity pools for user authentication. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
C. Configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users for user authentication. Attach an IAM policy that allows the AllowManageOwnUserMFA action. 
D. Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) authentication for user authentication. Configure the permission sets to require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
