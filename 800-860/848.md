A company runs its application on Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The company needs to migrate the application and the database to AWS. The company can use the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model while migrating to AWS. The application uses third-party database features that require privileged access. A solutions architect must design a solution for the database migration. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for Oracle by using native tools. Replace the third-party features with AWS Lambda. 
B. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle by using native tools. Customize the new database settings to support the third-party features. 
C. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Customize the new database settings to support the third-party features. 
D. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Rewrite the application code to remove the dependency on third-party features
