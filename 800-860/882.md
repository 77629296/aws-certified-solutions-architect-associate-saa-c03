A company runs its application by using Amazon EC2 instances and AWS Lambda functions. The EC2 instances run in private subnets of a VPC. The Lambda functions need direct network access to the EC2 instances for the application to work. The application will run for 1 year. The number of Lambda functions that the application uses will increase during the 1-year period. The company must minimize costs on all application resources. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnets that contain the EC2 instances. 
B. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to new public subnets in the same VPC where the EC2 instances run. 
C. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnets that contain the EC2 instances. 
D. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Keep the Lambda functions in the Lambda service VPC
