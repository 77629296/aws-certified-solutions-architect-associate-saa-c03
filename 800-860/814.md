Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

B. Migrate the container application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon MQ to retrieve the messages. 
C. Use highly available Amazon EC2 instances to run the application. Use Amazon MQ to retrieve the messages.
