A company is expanding a secure on-premises network to the AWS Cloud by using an AWS Direct Connect connection. The on-premises network has no direct internet access. An application that runs on the on-premises network needs to use an Amazon S3 bucket. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Create a public virtual interface (VIF). Route the AWS traffic over the public VIF. 
B. Create a VPC and a NAT gateway. Route the AWS traffic from the on-premises network to the NAT gateway. 
C. Create a VPC and an Amazon S3 interface endpoint. Route the AWS traffic from the on-premises network to the S3 interface endpoint. 
D. Create a VPC peering connection between the on-premises network and Direct Connect. Route the AWS traffic over the peering connection.
