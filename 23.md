A company is storing backup files by using Amazon S3 Standard storage. The files are accessed frequently for 1 month. However, the files are not accessed after 1 month. The company must keep the files indefinitely. Which storage solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects. 

B. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month. 

C. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month. 

D. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month.

Explain:
A: Incorrect - We know the pattern (accessed frequently for 1 month, NOT accessed after 1 month) so we can configure it manually to make the cost reduce as much as possible. 
B: Correct - Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective for file which rarely use 
C: Incorrect - Standard-Infrequent Access good for in Infrequent Access but not good for rarely(never) use. 
D: Incorrect - One Zone-Infrequent Access can reduce more cost compare to Standard-Infrequent Access but it is not the best way compare to Glacier Deep Archive
