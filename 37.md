A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use the EC2 serial console to directly access the terminal interface of each instance for administration. 

B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session. 

C. Create an administrative SSH key pair. Load the public key into each EC2 instance. Deploy a bastion host in a public subnet to provide a tunnel for administration of each instance. 

D. Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Instruct administrators to use their local on-premises machines to connect directly to the instances by using SSH keys across the VPN tunnel.

Explain:
Option A: The automation and flexibility required for secure administration at scale are not provided by using the EC2 serial terminal directly. 
Option C: There is more operational overhead and complexity when a bastion host is deployed. 
Option D: For secure instance administration, setting up an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection is too difficult and not the optimal approach. In conclusion, Option B is suggested as the best option given the given circumstances.
