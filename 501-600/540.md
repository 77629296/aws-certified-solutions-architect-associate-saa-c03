A company has an on-premises server that uses an Oracle database to process and store customer information. The company wants to use an AWS database service to achieve higher availability and to improve application performance. The company also wants to offload reporting from its primary database system. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally eficient way? 

A. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create an Amazon RDS DB instance in multiple AWS Regions. Point the reporting functions toward a separate DB instance from the primary DB instance. 
B. Use Amazon RDS in a Single-AZ deployment to create an Oracle database. Create a read replica in the same zone as the primary DB instance. Direct the reporting functions to the read replica. 
C. Use Amazon RDS deployed in a Multi-AZ cluster deployment to create an Oracle database. Direct the reporting functions to use the reader instance in the cluster deployment. 
D. Use Amazon RDS deployed in a Multi-AZ instance deployment to create an Amazon Aurora database. Direct the reporting functions to the reader instances

Multi-AZ DB clusters aren't available with the following engines: 
RDS for MariaDB 
RDS for Oracle 
RDS for SQL Server
