A consulting company provides professional services to customers worldwide. The company provides solutions and tools for customers to expedite gathering and analyzing data on AWS. The company needs to centrally manage and deploy a common set of solutions and tools for customers to use for self-service purposes. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Create AWS CloudFormation templates for the customers. 
B. Create AWS Service Catalog products for the customers. 
C. Create AWS Systems Manager templates for the customers. 
D. Create AWS Config items for the customers

AWS Service Catalog allows you to create and manage catalogs of IT services that can be deployed within your organization. With Service Catalog, you can define a standardized set of products (solutions and tools in this case) that customers can self-service provision. By creating Service Catalog products, you can control and enforce the deployment of approved and validated solutions and tools.
