A company deployed a serverless application that uses Amazon DynamoDB as a database layer. The application has experienced a large increase in users. The company wants to improve database response time from milliseconds to microseconds and to cache requests to the database. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). 
B. Migrate the database to Amazon Redshift. 
C. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS. 
D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.
