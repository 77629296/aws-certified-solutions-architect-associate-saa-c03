A company needs to connect several VPCs in the us-east-1 Region that span hundreds of AWS accounts. The company's networking team has its own AWS account to manage the cloud network. What is the MOST operationally eficient solution to connect the VPCs? 

A. Set up VPC peering connections between each VPC. Update each associated subnet’s route table 
B. Configure a NAT gateway and an internet gateway in each VPC to connect each VPC through the internet 
C. Create an AWS Transit Gateway in the networking team’s AWS account. Configure static routes from each VPC. 
D. Deploy VPN gateways in each VPC. Create a transit VPC in the networking team’s AWS account to connect to each VPC

The main difference between AWS Transit Gateway and VPC peering is that AWS Transit Gateway is designed to connect multiple VPCs together in a hub-and-spoke model, while VPC peering is designed to connect two VPCs together in a peer-to-peer model.
