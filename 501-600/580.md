A company uses locally attached storage to run a latency-sensitive application on premises. The company is using a lift and shift method to move the application to the AWS Cloud. The company does not want to change the application architecture. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to run the application. 
B. Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP2 volume to run the application. 
C. Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system to run the application. 
D. Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP3 volume to run the application.

GP3 offers identical latency performance to GP2 at a lower price point. 
FSx options are higher performance but more expensive and require application changes. 
GP3 aligns better with lift and shift needs as a directly attached block storage volume.
