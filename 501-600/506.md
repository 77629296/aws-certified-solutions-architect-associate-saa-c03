A social media company is building a feature for its website. The feature will give users the ability to upload photos. The company expects significant increases in demand during large events and must ensure that the website can handle the upload trafic from users. Which solution meets these requirements with the MOST scalability?

A. Upload files from the user's browser to the application servers. Transfer the files to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
B. Provision an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Upload files directly from the user's browser to the file gateway. 
C. Generate Amazon S3 presigned URLs in the application. Upload files directly from the user's browser into an S3 bucket. 
D. Provision an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Upload files directly from the user's browser to the file system.

This approach allows users to upload files directly to S3 without passing through the application servers, reducing the load on the application and improving scalability. It leverages the client-side capabilities to handle the file uploads and offloads the processing to S3.
