A company runs a stateful production application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application requires at least two EC2 instances to always be running. A solutions architect needs to design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for the application. The solutions architect creates an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances. Which set of additional steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? 

A. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy one On-Demand Instance in one Availability Zone and one On-Demand Instance in a second Availability Zone. 
B. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two On-Demand Instances in a second Availability Zone. 
C. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy four Spot Instances in one Availability Zone. 
D. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two Spot Instances in a second Availability Zone.

By setting the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four, the architect ensures that there are always at least two running instances. Deploying two On-Demand Instances in each of two Availability Zones ensures that the application is highly available and fault-tolerant. If one Availability Zone becomes unavailable, the application can still run in the other Availability Zone.
