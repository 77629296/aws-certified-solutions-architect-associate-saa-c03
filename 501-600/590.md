A. Create a read replica of the database. Direct the queries to the read replica. 
B. Create a backup of the database. Restore the backup to another DB instance. Direct the queries to the new database. 
C. Export the data to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to query the S3 bucket. 
D. Resize the DB instance to accommodate the additional workload
