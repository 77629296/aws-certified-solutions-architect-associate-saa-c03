A solutions architect is designing a highly available Amazon ElastiCache for Redis based solution. The solutions architect needs to ensure that failures do not result in performance degradation or loss of data locally and within an AWS Region. The solution needs to provide high availability at the node level and at the Region level. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Use Multi-AZ Redis replication groups with shards that contain multiple nodes. 
B. Use Redis shards that contain multiple nodes with Redis append only files (AOF) turned on. 
C. Use a Multi-AZ Redis cluster with more than one read replica in the replication group. 
D. Use Redis shards that contain multiple nodes with Auto Scaling turned on
