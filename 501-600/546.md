A recent analysis of a company's IT expenses highlights the need to reduce backup costs. The company's chief information officer wants to simplify the on-premises backup infrastructure and reduce costs by eliminating the use of physical backup tapes. The company must preserve the existing investment in the on-premises backup applications and work­ flows. What should a solutions architect recommend? 

A. Set up AWS Storage Gateway to connect with the backup applications using the NFS interface. 
B. Set up an Amazon EFS file system that connects with the backup applications using the NFS interface. 
C. Set up an Amazon EFS file system that connects with the backup applications using the iSCSI interface. 
D. Set up AWS Storage Gateway to connect with the backup applications using the iSCSI-virtual tape library (VTL) interface.

Use Tape Gateway to replace physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes on AWS—reducing your data storage costs without changing your tape-based backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on premises for low-latency data access. It compresses your tape data, encrypts it, and stores it in a virtual tape library in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). From there, you can transfer it to either Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive to help minimize your long-term storage costs.
