An Amazon EventBridge rule targets a third-party API. The third-party API has not received any incoming traffic. A solutions architect needs to determine whether the rule conditions are being met and if the rule's target is being invoked. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Check for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch in the namespace for AWS/Events. 
B. Review events in the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) dead-letter queue. 
C. Check for the events in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. 
D. Check the trails in AWS CloudTrail for the EventBridge events.

Option A is the most appropriate solution because Amazon EventBridge publishes metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. You can find relevant metrics in the "AWS/Events" namespace, which allows you to monitor the number of events matched by the rule and the number of invocations to the rule's target.
