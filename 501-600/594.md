A company plans to migrate to AWS and use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances for its application. During the migration testing phase, a technical team observes that the application takes a long time to launch and load memory to become fully productive. Which solution will reduce the launch time of the application during the next testing phase? 

A. Launch two or more EC2 On-Demand Instances. Turn on auto scaling features and make the EC2 On-Demand Instances available during the next testing phase. 
B. Launch EC2 Spot Instances to support the application and to scale the application so it is available during the next testing phase. 
C. Launch the EC2 On-Demand Instances with hibernation turned on. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling warm pools during the next testing phase. 
D. Launch EC2 On-Demand Instances with Capacity Reservations. Start additional EC2 instances during the next testing phase

Hibernation saves the in-memory state of the EC2 instance to persistent storage and shuts the instance down. When the instance is started again, the in-memory state is restored, which launches much faster than launching a new instance.
Warm pools pre-initialize EC2 instances and keep them ready to fulfill requests, reducing launch time. The hibernated instances can be added to a warm pool
