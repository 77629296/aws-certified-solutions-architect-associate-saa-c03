An ecommerce company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS provider. The company hosts its website on premises and in the AWS Cloud. The company's on-premises data center is near the us-west-1 Region. The company uses the eu-central-1 Region to host the website. The company wants to minimize load time for the website as much as possible. Which solution will meet these requirements? 

A. Set up a geolocation routing policy. Send the trafic that is near us-west-1 to the on-premises data center. Send the trafic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1. 
B. Set up a simple routing policy that routes all trafic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1 and routes all trafic that is near the on- premises datacenter to the on-premises data center. 
C. Set up a latency routing policy. Associate the policy with us-west-1. 
D. Set up a weighted routing policy. Split the trafic evenly between eu-central-1 and the on-premises data center.
