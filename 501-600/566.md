A company runs multiple Amazon EC2 Linux instances in a VPC across two Availability Zones. The instances host applications that use a hierarchical directory structure. The applications need to read and write rapidly and concurrently to shared storage. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Allow access from all the EC2 instances in the VPC. 
B. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system from each EC2 instance. 
C. Create a file system on a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Attach the EBS volume to all the EC2 instances. 
D. Create file systems on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to each EC2 instance. Synchronize the EBS volumes across the different EC2 instances.

hierarchical directory structure, read and write rapidly and concurrently to shared storage = Amazon Elastic File System
Because Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) volume to multiple instances that are in the same Availability Zone.
