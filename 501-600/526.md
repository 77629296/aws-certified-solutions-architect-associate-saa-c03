A solutions architect is reviewing the resilience of an application. The solutions architect notices that a database administrator recently failed over the application's Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database writer instance as part of a scaling exercise. The failover resulted in 3 minutes of downtime for the application. Which solution will reduce the downtime for scaling exercises with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Create more Aurora PostgreSQL read replicas in the cluster to handle the load during failover. 
B. Set up a secondary Aurora PostgreSQL cluster in the same AWS Region. During failover, update the application to use the secondary cluster's writer endpoint. 
C. Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster to handle the load during failover. 
D. Set up an Amazon RDS proxy for the database. Update the application to use the proxy endpoint.
