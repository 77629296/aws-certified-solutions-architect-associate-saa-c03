A company uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve content pages for its website. The company needs to ensure that clients use a TLS certificate when accessing the company's website. The company wants to automate the creation and renewal of the TLS certificates. Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational eficiency? 

A. Use a CloudFront security policy to create a certificate. 
B. Use a CloudFront origin access control (OAC) to create a certificate. 
C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate. Use DNS validation for the domain. 
D. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate. Use email validation for the domain


ACM provides managed renewal for your Amazon-issued SSL/TLS certificates. This means that ACM will either renew your certificates automatically (if you are using DNS validation), or it will send you email notices when expiration is approaching. These services are provided for both public and private ACM certificates
