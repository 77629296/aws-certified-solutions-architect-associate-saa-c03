A company runs an application on AWS. The application receives inconsistent amounts of usage. The application uses AWS Direct Connect to connect to an on-premises MySQL-compatible database. The on-premises database consistently uses a minimum of 2 GiB of memory. The company wants to migrate the on-premises database to a managed AWS service. The company wants to use auto scaling capabilities to manage unexpected workload increases. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead? 

A. Provision an Amazon DynamoDB database with default read and write capacity settings. 
B. Provision an Amazon Aurora database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU). 
C. Provision an Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU). 
D. Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL database with 2 GiB of memory

Aurora Serverless v2 provides auto-scaling so the database can handle inconsistent workloads and spikes automatically without admin intervention. 
It can scale down to zero when not in use to minimize costs. The minimum 1 ACU capacity is sufficient to replace the on-prem 2 GiB database based on the info given. 
Serverless capabilities reduce admin overhead for capacity management.
