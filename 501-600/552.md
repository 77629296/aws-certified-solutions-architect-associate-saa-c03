A company needs to optimize the cost of its Amazon EC2 instances. The company also needs to change the type and family of its EC2 instances every 2-3 months. What should the company do to meet these requirements? 

A. Purchase Partial Upfront Reserved Instances for a 3-year term. 
B. Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term. 
C. Purchase All Upfront Reserved Instances for a 1-year term. 
D. Purchase an All Upfront EC2 Instance Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

The company needs flexibility to change EC2 instance types and families every 2-3 months. This rules out Reserved Instances which lock you into an instance type and family for 1-3 years. 
A Compute Savings Plan allows switching instance types and families freely within the term as needed. No Upfront is more flexible than All Upfront. 
A 1-year term balances commitment and flexibility better than a 3-year term given the company's changing needs.
With No Upfront, the company only pays for usage monthly without an upfront payment. This optimizes cost.
