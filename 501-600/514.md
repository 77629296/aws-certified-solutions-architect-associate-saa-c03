A company is running a microservices application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company wants to migrate the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster for scalability. The company must configure the Amazon EKS control plane with endpoint private access set to true and endpoint public access set to false to maintain security compliance. The company must also put the data plane in private subnets. However, the company has received error notifications because the node cannot join the cluster. Which solution will allow the node to join the cluster? 
A. Grant the required permission in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to the AmazonEKSNodeRole IAM role. 
B. Create interface VPC endpoints to allow nodes to access the control plane. 
C. Recreate nodes in the public subnet. Restrict security groups for EC2 nodes. 
D. Allow outbound trafic in the security group of the nodes.
