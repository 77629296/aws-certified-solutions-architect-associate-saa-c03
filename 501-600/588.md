An ecommerce company wants a disaster recovery solution for its Amazon RDS DB instances that run Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition. The company's current recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) are 24 hours. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Create a cross-Region read replica and promote the read replica to the primary instance. 
B. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create RDS cross-Region replication. 
C. Use cross-Region replication every 24 hours to copy native backups to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
D. Copy automatic snapshots to another Region every 24 hours.

Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster during the backup window of your DB instance. RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. RDS saves the automated backups of your DB instance according to the backup retention period that you specify. If necessary, you can recover your DB instance to any point in time during the backup retention period.
