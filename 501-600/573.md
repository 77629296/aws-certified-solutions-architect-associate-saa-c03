A company wants to use an event-driven programming model with AWS Lambda. The company wants to reduce startup latency for Lambda functions that run on Java 11. The company does not have strict latency requirements for the applications. The company wants to reduce cold starts and outlier latencies when a function scales up. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Configure Lambda provisioned concurrency. 
B. Increase the timeout of the Lambda functions. 
C. Increase the memory of the Lambda functions. 
D. Configure Lambda SnapStart

SnapStart keeps functions initialized and ready to respond quickly, eliminating cold starts. 
SnapStart is optimized for applications without aggressive latency needs, reducing costs. 
It scales automatically to match traffic spikes, eliminating outliers when scaling up. 
SnapStart is a native Lambda feature with no additional charges, keeping costs low
