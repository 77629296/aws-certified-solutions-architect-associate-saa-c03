## Exam purpose
To learn about architecture knowledge and practice English simultaneously.

## Learning Journey
- I recommend taking Stephane Maarek's course on Udemy. I listened to it intermittently for a month.
- I practiced over 800 English questions consistently for a month.

## Things Learned After Attending the Exam
- If you choose English as the exam language, you can apply for language convenience before scheduling the exam. Once the exam is scheduled, no further applications can be made.
- The English name provided when creating an AWS Builder account must match the corresponding auxiliary documents, such as a passport. During the exam, you need to bring your ID card and relevant auxiliary documents.
- If possible, choose the online exam to complete it in a quiet environment. I attended an offline exam in an open classroom with constant people coming in and out, but luckily, the exam room provided noise-canceling headphones.
