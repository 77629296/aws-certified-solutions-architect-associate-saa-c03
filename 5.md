A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time. What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once? 
一家公司正在使用单个 Amazon EC2 实例在 AWS 上托管 Web 应用程序，该实例将用户上传的文档存储在 Amazon EBS 卷中。为了获得更好的可扩展性和可用性，该公司复制了该架构，并在另一个可用区中创建了第二个 EC2 实例和 EBS 卷，将两者都置于 Application Load Balancer 之后。完成此更改后，用户报告说，每次刷新网站时，他们都可以看到文档的一个子集或另一个子集，但不能同时看到所有文档。解决方案架构师应该提出什么建议来确保用户一次看到他们的所有文档？

A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents 
A. 复制数据，使两个 EBS 卷都包含所有文档 

B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
B. 连接 Application Load Balancer 以使用文档将用户定向到服务器

C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
C. 将数据从两个 EBS 卷复制到 Amazon EFS。修改应用程序以将新文档保存到 Amazon EFS 
Explain: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a simple, scalable, elastic file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is designed to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as files are added and removed. By moving the documents to EFS, both EC2 instances can access all the documents at the same time, resolving the issue.

D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server
D. 连接 Application Load Balancer 以将请求发送到两个服务器。从正确的服务器返回每个文档
