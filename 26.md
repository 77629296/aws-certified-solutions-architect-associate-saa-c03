A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes. What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal? 

A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules. 

B. Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor with the appropriate checks. 

C. Turn on Amazon Inspector with the appropriate assessment template. 

D. Turn on Amazon S3 server access logging. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon Cloud Watch Events)

Explain:
AWS Config is a service that provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your account. By enabling AWS Config, you can capture configuration changes and maintain a record of resource configurations over time. It allows you to define rules that check for compliance with desired configurations and can generate alerts or automated actions when unauthorized changes occur. To accomplish the goal of preventing unauthorized configuration changes in Amazon S3 buckets, you can configure AWS Config rules specifically for S3 bucket configurations. These rules can check for a variety of conditions, such as ensuring that encryption is enabled, access control policies are correctly configured, and public access is restricted. While options B, C, and D offer valuable services for various aspects of AWS deployment, they are not specifically focused on preventing unauthorized configuration changes in Amazon S3 buckets as effectively as enabling AWS Config.
